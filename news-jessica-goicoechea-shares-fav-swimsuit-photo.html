"Fav swimsuit," she captioned the post. "Wow!" a fan commented. Goicoechea works hard for her physique—so how exactly does she do it? Here are 5 ways the model stays fit and camera-ready.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/shutterstock_1414338905.jpg><p><span>Goicoechea swears by soy milk for a healthy start to the day. "[I have] a good breakfast to start the day with energy," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I don't have a fixed breakfast, or else one day I feel like milk with cereal and another day a good natural juice… I recently discovered Strawberry Tomato Watermelon Soup, and I absolutely loved it!"</span></p><p><span>Goicoechea credits healthy lifestyle habits with her spectacular physique. "Training and with perseverance," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Luckily I have good genetics but you have to keep fit and for that you need discipline. I exercise four or five days a week, if my schedule allows it. Among the activities I do include weights, yoga or pole dancing."</span></p><p><span>Goicoechea follows a pescatarian diet. "I do not give too much importance to diet, I am a good eater," she says. "Simply, before a shoot I try not to bloat myself to see myself in top shape. But I'm not saying no to anything. Lately I am reducing the consumption of meat and I can say that I already consider myself 100% pescatarian."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Goicoechea switches up her exercises depending on the type of work she is doing. "I try to keep my body active during the week at Club Bonasport. I do functional training and yoga classes to relax my mind, while cultivating my body," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Besides, I'm also doing pole dance classes: I'm learning recently, but I love it, it's fun and it keeps me in shape. Summer swimwear campaigns are a 'must' in my work, including those for my clothing brand, GOI. For all of them the body requires more specific training. With [trainer] Ana Luisa this year we have worked a lot on the buttocks and abs to be perfect all summer. I'm working on elasticity. I am flexible, but I would like to be more, so we are reinforcing this point. I'm making a lot of progress and I'm really happy with the results."</span></p><p><span>Goicoechea keeps her beauty routine very simple, especially during the warmer months. "Very natural," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "In summer, if I'm a brunette, I don't even use a foundation! Just mascara (from Maybelline), a little blush and, above all, a nude lip – it's my favorite. I try not to overload it with creams, and I love using toners . My favorites are those with rose water."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko52jqLakrYygpqKbn5qwqbHAZqqhmaKawG6ywK9krK%2BZosC2tdNmp6GnpKR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
