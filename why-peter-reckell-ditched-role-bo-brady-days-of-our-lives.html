Contrary to rumors, Reckell denied that it was a money issue that prompted his decision. "The money thing wasn't an issue for me," he explained. "Not having a storyline, not being able to do anything artistic there was my issue ... I just want the people who support me to know the real reason why I'm not there." In 2015, he told <a href=#>Michael Fairman</a> that he didn't think staying on "DOOL"&nbsp;was worth sacrificing his precious time with his family for. "My decision was, 'If I'm not going to be utilized, then I am not going to be part of mainstream storylines," he said. "I would much rather not miss out on my daughter's life. Not miss out on her discoveries of her life, and not be an impact on her, and not share her life with her." The choices he's making are about keeping his family the top priority.</p><p>However, despite his insistence on leaving the soap, Reckell stressed that he isn't closing his doors on returning to "DOOL" in the near future. [Executive Producer] Ken Corday said the door is always open and that's been true for me," he told Soap Opera Digest. "If there's a way for me to be involved in the show as an artist, that's always a possibility."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhaIR1gY6wn7JloJrBpr6Mq5yco5WhuW6wyK2aoZ2UYr%2BwuMRmmahlkqeupcWMnZiyq12ks2671KtkpaGmmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
