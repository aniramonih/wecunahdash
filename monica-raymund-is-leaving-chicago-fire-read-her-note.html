They’ve always been playing toward that. But just because I think they do, things happen in life,” he said on our Watch With Us podcast. “That’s the sadness of it, but I think they know that they’re a good couple together and they’ve been through a lot. It’d be sad to see something like a baby comes up, they can’t figure out or move around or work together on … it is kind of tragic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued: “If the relationship couldn’t last, then it would be good for Casey to be single and focus on being a firefighter again. I think, taking time to take a step back from relationships and to gather himself again … they’ve seen a lot of tragedy so they’re good at picking up the pieces and moving on. I’d like to see Casey be a single guy and really focus on his job and do what he does best.”</p><p>Chicago Fire is set to return to NBC in the fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSoppmYrm6%2BwLKkrqaUYra0ecuemK%2Bhnpx6pLTInJigp12btrOxjKucmpxdnbKzec2oq55n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
