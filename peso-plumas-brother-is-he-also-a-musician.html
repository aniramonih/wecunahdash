But what do we know about his family and personal life? Does he have any siblings who share his passion for music? In this article, we will explore the rumors and facts about Peso Pluma’s brother and his relationship with the famous singer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Peso Pluma?</h2><p>Peso Pluma, whose real name is Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija, was born on June 15, 1999, in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. He grew up in Guadalajara and learned to play the guitar at age 15 by watching videos on YouTube. He started writing songs in a diary, inspired by regional Mexican music. He collaborated with his cousin, Roberto “Tito” Laija Garcia, also known as Tito Double P, on releasing two live albums in 2020.</p><p>Peso Pluma gained popularity with his debut single “El Belicón” in 2022, which sold 480,000 units and was certified 8× Platinum Latin by the RIAA. He followed up his success with the extended play Sembrando and the controversial duet “Siempre Pendientes” with Luis R Conriquez, which entered the Billboard Global 200. His collaborations with Natanael Cano, “AMG” and “PRC”, became viral hits on TikTok and charted on the Billboard Hot 100. In April 2023, he made history with Eslabon Armado with “Ella Baila Sola”, being the first regional Mexican song to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Peso Pluma is known for his distinct musical style dominated by corridos tumbados, which are Sinaloa-style sierreño corridos with elements of Latin urban music, such as Latin hip hop and reggaeton. He is considered to be a major contributor to the revival of corridos and a crossover sensation in the Latin music industry. He is the most streamed artist in Mexico and has won several awards and nominations for his work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Peso Pluma have a brother?</h2><p>Despite Peso Pluma’s fame and success, little is known about his personal life and family. According to some sources, he comes from a musical family, as both of his parents are also musicians. His father has Lebanese ancestry and was born in Chiapas, while his mother’s relatives are from Badiraguato, Sinaloa. However, the names and identities of his parents are not publicly known.</p><p>As for his siblings, there is no official confirmation or denial that he has any brothers or sisters. However, some rumors suggest that he has a brother who is also a TikTok creator. The alleged brother goes by the name of Pelonoscar19 and has over 1.5 million followers on the platform. He posts videos of himself dancing, singing, and joking around with his friends. Some of his videos feature Peso Pluma’s songs or mention him as his brother.</p><p>However, there is no evidence that Pelonoscar19 is actually related to Peso Pluma by blood or adoption. Neither of them has confirmed or denied their relationship on social media or interviews. It is possible that they are just friends or fans of each other’s work.

They often comment on each other’s posts and show support and admiration for each other’s talents. They also seem to have a similar sense of humor and style.</p><p>However, if Pelonoscar19 is not Peso Pluma’s brother, then it is unclear what their relationship is based on. They could be friends who share a mutual interest in music and entertainment. They could also be collaborators who use each other’s popularity to boost their own careers. Or they could be simply using their alleged brotherhood as a marketing strategy to attract more attention and followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Peso Pluma is one of the most successful and influential Latin artists of his generation. He has achieved remarkable feats in the music industry with his unique style and charisma. However, he has also kept his personal life and family away from the public eye.

Whether they are brothers or not, they seem to have a positive connection and respect for each other’s work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6WytLuMqaOupZGoeqO%2Bzq2fnqpdnsButMRmmKWrn2KubrnUrKCcoZGjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
