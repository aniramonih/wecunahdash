“There were some things I was nervous about, but it was all easily resolved,” the Bravolebrity, 31, explains, adding that she’s simply been “letting the professionals do their thing” in helping with the planning process."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Madison reveals she and Brett are only having “30 to 35 people” attend their big day. “It’s Brett’s family and my family, and we each invited three of our closest friends,” she says. “So, it’s just going to be intimate.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>That doesn’t mean she’ll play it safe on her wedding day look. The Maven Salon founder acknowledges many people want to see her “bring it when it comes to hair and makeup” and she definitely has big plans. “I have naturally curly hair, so I’m going to play that up.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for Brett, Madison says he was “fairly involved” at the beginning of wedding planning before stepping back a bit. “He’s one of eight, so he has a lot of family, and his concern was, ‘Where are they all going to go?’ But then he was like, ‘You got it,’” she explains. “He’s liked everything we’ve picked out, and he trusts me. We just bought a house, and it’s the same thing — I’m like, ‘Just let me do my thing, and I’ll let you see it when it gets delivered!’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Surprisingly, the “hard” part has been dealing with the “different personalities” of Madison’s friends. “I was like, ‘Listen, if you don’t like her and she doesn’t like you, just don’t tell me until it’s all over,’” she says.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The hair stylist announced her engagement to Brett in October 2021, six months after they started dating. Madison was previously married to <b>Josh Hughes</b> from 2010 to 2015, and they share their son, Hudson. As far as if the reality star plans on expanding her brood with Brett, she says, “If I knew they would all turn out like Hudson, I’d have a houseful!”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/291819887_1449177442188387_5661540926979456038_n.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Although Madison and Brett are getting ready to walk down the aisle, don’t expect the account manager to appear on <i>Southern Charm </i>any time soon. Brett opted to not appear in any scenes during the latest season.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“He wants to see how this season goes and then let me know,” Madison explains. “It takes a very interesting personality to be willing to put your life out there like that.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>That being said, viewers will witness the blonde beauty <a href=#>kicking back during a lot of season 8</a>.</span><span class=s1> “You can see me drinking a lot of champagne because there are a bunch of situations where I’m not in the drama, which is so nice!” she quips. “Being an outsider is awesome.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJopJqcmai8r3nLnpqrp6moerixw52gp59dqbxurtGeq61lopa7pbjEZpueq6Seu6LAyKilZp%2BlmsC1ecuiqq1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
