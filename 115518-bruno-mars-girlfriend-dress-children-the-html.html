Caban, 36, took to Instagram to share a picture of her and Mars in character as the iconic fictional household that dates back to the 1930s.
Caban channeled Wednesday in her trademark black dress, white collar, and dark twin braids. The “Uptown Funk” chose to go as Wednesday’s brother, Pugsley, who is known for wearing striped shirts similar to the one Mars had on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite being together for seven years, Mars and his model girlfriend keep their relationship very private. Apart from a few Grammy Award red carpets, the two are almost never pictured together.</p><p><h3 class=ih>MEXICO GETAWAY</h3></p><p class=dh>About two months ago, Mars, 33, was <a class="me a" href=#>spotted</a> with his lady love as they spent a luxurious vacation in Punta Mita, Mexico. The “Finesse” singer was taking a break from his ongoing world tour when paparazzi took photos of him with a fuller figure and a protruding belly.</p><p class=dh>Mars didn’t seem to be hiding his figure anyway since he was shirtless and donned only patterned beach shorts. At one point, he kept his curls under a large sun hat before showing them off braided.</p><p class=dh>Caban was with him on that trip and showed off her toned midriff and long legs in a black and yellow leopard-print swimwear.</p><p class=dh>Earlier this year, Caban, who also has a swimwear line, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.msn.com/en-au/entertainment/celebrity/who-is-bruno-marss-girlfriend-get-to-know-his-long-time-love-jessica-caban/ar-BBIuspu>accompanied</a> her man to the Grammy Awards where he took home the prize in all his nominated categories.</p><p class=dh>Besides representing Jennifer Lopez's clothing line, “J-LO,” Caban is also an actress and reality star who won the first ever “Model Latina” in 2008.</p><p><h3 class=ih>NO MARRIAGE PLANS</h3></p><p class=dh>The beauty <a class="me a" href=#>reportedly</a> met Mars when she was living in New York and moved into his LA home after only one year of dating. Mars’ heart-wrenching ballad “When I Was Your Man” is also said to be about Caban.</p><p class=dh>Despite their love story, Mars and Caban are not likely to be walking down the aisle anytime soon. The “Grenade” singer replied after he was asked about marriage:</p><p class=dh>“Jesus! She’s my best friend. My rock. What’s wrong with that? We’re just happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpobm1hbXqjvtSnpmalkafAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5w6ucrKtdmLWquMOrnKdlpJ2yb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
