He claimed, “My history entrusts me with this duty.”</p><p>As a Muslim athlete of Turkish ancestry, he feels he has assimilated well and works to set an example for his fans.</p><p>To paraphrase, “so many people, not just Turkish people, but the Muslim community in Germany, I am one of those personalities to try to help,” he stated.</p><p>Gundogan is the latest in a long line of prominent German players who also happen to be Muslims.</p><p>Gündoan’s father, Irfan, and his siblings relocated to Germany in 1979.

The event sparked backlash, and when Gündoan played for Germany a few weeks later, the country’s supporters jeered at him.</p><p>Gundogan almost caused another incident when he “liked” a post by Tosun on Instagram in which Tosun celebrated a goal and expressed sympathy for Turkish soldiers fighting Kurdish forces in Syria.</p><p>He explained why he unliked something by saying, “After last year, the last thing I wanted to do was make a political statement.” He went on to say that he was happy for [Tosun], a former teammate on Germany’s U21 squad.</p><p>Gundogan just tied the knot with his lover Sara Arfaoui. According to reports, the couple began dating in early 2021 and tied the marriage in May of the following year.</p><p>Sara is an Italian-born model and actress of French descent.
