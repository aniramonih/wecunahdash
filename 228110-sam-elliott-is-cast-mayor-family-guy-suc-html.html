He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.cbr.com/family-guy-sam-elliot-quahog-mayor/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Sam has a voice that — obviously he's a movie star, but he also has a voice made for the radio, and Sam Elliot quickly became our first choice."</p><p class=dh>As Mayor of Quahog, Elliott's character will appear on the show as <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenrant.com/family-guy-cast-sam-elliott-new-mayor-photos/>West's cousin</a> from the Wild, Wild West - referencing the Oscar-nominated actor's mark as a Western movie and TV star.</p><p class=dh>The character, who has the appearance as Elliott in real life, is reported to enter the show after Peter Griffin would hunt him and convince him to be the new mayor.</p><p class=dh>But before Elliott took the role, he initially turned down the offer as he feared that the part was too imitative.

West's role as Mayor Adam West was a memorable and hilarious character and was truly a centerpiece of the series.</p><p class=dh>Some of West's unforgettable episodes were <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/17/family-guy-mayor-adam-west-highlight-reel/>compiled</a> in a 9-minute video, highlighting his character's joyful and comedic chops and delighting his legion of fans.</p><p class=dh>The executive producer said that West's vocal performance and the comedic angle he brought to the role was incomparable.

But he did not achieve his success overnight.</p><p class=dh>One interesting fact about MacFarlane is that before he made "Family Guy," he first landed a job as a weekly comic strip writer at the age of nine, an unlikely feat for most children his age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpcWlhZXq0rcxmnKWkmaTBtXnIrGScmaOpeq6t2KipZp6RoratxYygrLJlo6qwb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
