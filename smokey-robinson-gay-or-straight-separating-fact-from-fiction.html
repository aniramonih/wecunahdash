However, the next year saw Robinson’s comeback to the music industry as a solo artist. When Motown Records was sold in 1988, Robinson decided to leave the label the following year.</p><h2 id=smokey-robinson-early-life>Smokey Robinson Early Life</h2><p>William Robinson Jr. was born into a low-income African-American household in Detroit’s North End.

He’s been accused of being gay, but there’s no evidence to support that claim.</p><p>We checked out several of his interviews, and he never once mentioned his s*xual name. Smokey Robinson’s voice was and is undeniably impressive. He was now able to speak his mind freely.</p><p>Since he did not, no one can give him credit for being someone he is not. For what reason, therefore, do some people insist the American singer is gay if he is in fact straight?</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;Is Eddie Scarry Gay?

In 1975, when being was still something to be ashamed of, Robinson published this song.

The Robinsons’ 1986 divorce was completed after Robinson first filed for legal separation and then divorce due to his extramarital affair.</p><p>During their 1974 divorce, Robinson had an affair that would later inspire his song “The Agony & The Ecstasy,” which would appear on his album A Quiet Storm.</p><p>Related:</p><h2 id=smokey-robinsons-past-relationship>Smokey Robinson’s Past Relationship</h2><p>Robinson wed Frances Gladney in 2002. Together, they own a winery and skincare company called Skinphonic out of Pittsburgh. Robinson told The Cut that he takes better care of his skin than most men do.</p><p>The singer’s attractiveness and taste in clothing have fueled speculation about his sexual orientation, but he seemed unconcerned. He stated to The Cut:</p><p>Men do not put as much thought into skin care as women do. My skin is now much more even and smooth after using this product. I’m a black man who ashes regularly, plays golf and spends time in the sun, and has clear skin.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Smokey Robinson Jr. is a famous American musician who has been accused of being gay, and his life and career have been affected by these allegations.
