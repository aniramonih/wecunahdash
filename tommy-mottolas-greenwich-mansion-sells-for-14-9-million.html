The Wall Street Journal reports that Mottola's nine-bedroom, 11.5-bath mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut was recently sold for nearly $15 million. The asking price was just $15.5 million, not too far removed from the eventual sale price, but if you compare the sale price to the home's original listing price when it was first put on the market in 2017, the sale represented a significant discount of some 25 percent.</p><p>The property spreads across a little more than 5.7 acres, which Mottola and his wife of 20 years (Mexican pop star Thalia) purchased back in 2010 for $2.85 million. The house itself was custom-built according to his own design, and the Georgian Colonial style mansion is well in line with the reputation Mottola has cultivated for living in extreme luxury, having bought and sold several other large mansions over the years. In addition to the expected amenities, the house also includes special touches like a full service spa suite and even a small island with its own footbridge across the pond outside.</p><p>Here's how Jennifer Leahy of Connecticut's Douglas Elliman Real Estate describes the lavish home:</p><strong>"The sun drenched formal areas are modern & inviting, the top of the line chef's kitchen lends itself for gracious entertaining. The master suite offers the ultimate lifestyle for the discerning and features his-and-her two story dressing rooms. The lower level has a gym, playroom, beauty salon,& massage room. The beauty of the property is captured from the pool, terrace, outdoor kitchen & fireplace that overlook the serene lake accessed by footbridge to your own private island."</strong><p>That's from the description of the YouTube video below, which gives you a brief tour of the former home of Mr. Mottola.
