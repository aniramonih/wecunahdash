Riot does a preseason update in League of Legends at the start of every year. It is an experimental time for the game, as the developers release all the newer addition and changes at once, and players can try them out. Additionally, the ranks are not saved during that time, so players can try out the new changes and items without any downsides."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is an experimental time for the game, as the developers release all the newer addition and changes at once, and players can try them out. Additionally, the ranks are not saved during that time, so players can try out the new changes and items without any downsides.</p><p>Besides preseason, Riot also changes the game massively during the mid-season. During mid-season, Riot implements changes that were either supposed to come during preseason or caused by shifting meta after the season’s start.</p><p>Last year, we saw Riot implement the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> durability rework</a> as the mid-season rework. On that patch, they increased the base health of all champions and tweaked the stats. Riot did that update because the game had a colossal damage problem up to that point. Essentially, every champion before that time was doing a high amount of damage. And the durability patch fixed that inherent problem.</p><p>And for this season, we will also see a similar mid-season update. A week ago, Riot revealed their plans for the game through a dev log. And on that video, they unveiled that a huge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">itemization change</a> was coming.</p><p>These itemization changes include many mythic items being demoted to legendary and many legendary items being promoted to mythic. One such item is Youmuu’s Ghostblade. In the upcoming mid-season update, Youmuu’s will become a mythic item for the assassins, replacing Prowler’s Claw.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LoL New Support Mythic Echoes of Helia.</a></p><h2 id=new-mythic-youmuu8217s-ghostblade class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">New Mythic: Youmuu’s Ghostblade</h2><h3 id=tooltip class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Tooltip</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-19.png><h3 id=stats class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Stats</h3><ul><li>60 Attack Damage</li><li>18 Lethality</li><li>20 Ability Haste</li><li><strong>Active – Wraith Step</strong> – Gain 25% move speed and Ghosting for 6 seconds (45s CD), during this time generate stacks 2 times faster.</li><li><strong>Haunt</strong> – Gain up to 100 Spectral Shards while moving, Gain up to 50 move speed out of champion combat based on the number of Spectral Shards.
