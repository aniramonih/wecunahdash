Christine’s fiancé, <a href=#><strong>David Woolley</strong></a>, could be seen lounging in the background.</p><p>Gwendlyn and her wife enjoyed a slow dance in another snap — with Kody, 54, noticeably sitting on a bench in the corner holding a baby.</p><p>Elsewhere in the slideshow, Christine and David <a href=#>stood on either side of the brides</a> at golden hour. Christine glowed in a hot pink dress with her blonde locks cascading down her shoulders. Her husband-to-be, meanwhile, <a href=#>opted for a more casual look</a> in a checkered button-down shirt and jeans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kody-Brown-Spotted-Celebrating-Daughter-Gwendlyn-Wedding-Alongside-Ex-Christine-Her-Fiance-3.jpg><p>Fans initially believed Kody — who shares <a href=#>a total of 18 children</a> with four women — wasn’t present on <a href=#>Gwendlyn’s wedding day</a>. Gwendlyn announced via Instagram on Sunday, July 16, that she and Queiroz had tied the knot, simply <a href=#>celebrating the milestone</a> with a PDA pic.</p><p>“Say hello to mrs (x2) queiroz,” she wrote.</p><p>In a second Instagram upload, Gwendlyn gave a closer look at the reception in Flagstaff, Arizona. Kody’s fourth wife, <a href=#><strong>Robyn Brown</strong></a>, appeared in the background of a video despite questions about her presence at the celebration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kody-Brown-Spotted-Celebrating-Daughter-Gwendlyn-Wedding-Alongside-Ex-Christine-Her-Fiance-2.jpg><p>Gwendlyn’s relationship with her father <a href=#>has seemingly been rocky</a> since his 2021 split from Christine. The exes — who share six children — <a href=#>documented their breakup</a> on season 17 of <a href=#>Sister Wives</a>, which showed Christine moving to Utah with daughter Truely.</p><p>Kody has since split from wives <a href=#><strong>Meri Brown</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Janelle Brown</strong></a>, to whom he was spiritually married, but he <a href=#>remains in a legal union</a> with Robyn, 44. Since the season 17 finale aired in December 2022, Gwendlyn has been vocal about her highs and lows as a member of the famous plural family.</p><p>While <a href=#>rewatching past episodes</a> of the TLC series for her YouTube channel, Gwendlyn asserted that <a href=#>she wasn’t taking sides between her parents</a> as they navigated their divorce. “I was like, ‘You’re leaving? Good for you!'” she recalled in a December 2022 YouTube video of her response to Christine and Kody’s split. “She told me she was moving and divorcing my father all at the same time, so I was all hype for her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kody-Brown-Spotted-Celebrating-Daughter-Gwendlyn-Wedding-Alongside-Ex-Christine-Her-Fiance.jpg><p>Along with being a vocal critic of <a href=#>Kody’s polygamist lifestyle</a>, Gwendlyn has been candid about her feelings toward Robyn. “<a href=#>I don’t really like her as a person</a>,” she confessed via her vlog. “Watching her [on Sister Wives] makes me like her less, for sure.”</p><p>Kody’s changing family dynamic will be explored even further during season 18 of Sister Wives, which debuts in August. In the first teaser, <a href=#>Kody laments about his failed marriages</a>. “I worked so hard to do what was right,” he tells the camera. “And when you lose that, well, I should just be the devil I think I am now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp5SueqO%2BzrClZqugpMG1scNmmK1llJbCqLTTnqlmn6eau6W42KeqZq%2BVmbGqusZmrqKsmGKyuXnCoamiq6Seu6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
