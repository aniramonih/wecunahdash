This article explores who Ron and Betty are, what they do for a living and Ron’s recent battle with cancer.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV691590 Day Fiancé | Before the 90 Days Season 5 Trailer910039910039center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fiance-who-are-ron-and-betty>90 Day Fiance: Who are Ron and Betty?</h2><p>Ron and Betty are stars on TLC, and although they aren’t leading cast members they are still just as well known.</p><p>Both Ron and Betty studied at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, suggesting that they are college sweethearts. The pair got married on the 28th of September 1991, which Betty has described as the day she married “the man of my dreams”.</p><p>The pair are known for being very protective of their son, Brandon, who lived with them up until he moved out with Julia. Brandon and Julia lived with Betty and Ron at their family farm, and because of this Julia never really bonded with his parents – as it was all a bit too much for Julia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 90Day_Betty Gibbs (@90day_bettygibbs)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ron-and-betty-s-careers>Ron and Betty’s careers</h2><p>As we know from 90 Day Fiance, Ron and Betty own Hummingbird Acres Farm, which is located in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. This is where the pair reside (with some extra company from their farm animals).</p><p>On their <a href=#>website</a>, they state that they raise all-natural, pastured Katahdin Lambs/Sheep, Nigerian Dwarf Goats, Registered Kune Kune Pigs and Poultry. They also breed European Imported German Shepherd Dogs and monkey-faced European Imported Brussels Griffons.</p><p>According to Betty’s <a href=#>LinkedIn</a>, she has also worked at Main Line Broadcasting/Alpha Media in Richmond as a controller since November 2007.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 90Day_Betty Gibbs (@90day_bettygibbs)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ron-had-a-health-scare-last-year>Ron had a health scare last year</h2><p>After Ron’s recent health problems, fans of the couple were eagerly waiting for an update on his health.</p><p>Brandon shared a post on his Instagram to update viewers, as he told them that his father’s mystery illness was cancer. When Ron went for a colonoscopy in 2020, the doctors found a tumour, however, they were able to remove it surgically as it was caught early.</p><p>Ron also told fans: “I did go through 30 days of chemo and radiation just to be sure that I got everything, and I did a CT scan about 30 days after that”, and he is “now free and clear of any cancer”.</p><p>Fans of the couple were quick to comment on the news. One follower wrote: “Yay!!! So happy to hear the good news!!! God is good!!!!!”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 90Day_Betty Gibbs (@90day_bettygibbs)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH 90 DAY FIANCÉ: BEFORE THE 90 DAYS ON SUNDAYS AT 8/7C ON TLC</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnl5rBbsDOZqKnp6dir7OtzZ2mp6tdpa6zsc2tqmaqn6N6orrDZpmerKSuerC6jHJnZpyRrnqntcCnmp4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
