After Sarah Jessica shared her condolences following the death of Kim's brother, the Samantha Jones actress wrote: "My Mom asked me today, 'When will that @sarahjessicaparker, that hypocrite, leave you alone?' Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven't already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I'm writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ef51mifGWHRq><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;Sarah Jessica Parker says her twins loves to dress in their mum's old clothes</a></p><p id=ek_7IstbM0Yo data-wc=92>Sarah Jessica added that she didn't want the recent comments to overshadow the series, explaining: "We are enormously proud of what we got to do and I don't want someone sharing thoughts publicly, which is Kim's right to do and that is what it is, but we spent ten, 12 years of our life doing something that I really loved and I feel privileged to be part of and I don't want this to eclipse it or change its experience for that audience that was so good to us for so long."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
