I was so tired of hearing all the scandle errtime Steve’s name gets mentioned its all about Marjories daughter. Whew… the twins look GREAT Mr. HARVEY. Now you can relate to the old stories about who you let in your house.”</p><p>“@barbbree i hear ya girl 🔥🔥🔥why we dont hear about the 3 oldest children,” someone agreed.</p><p>“The real harvey girls,” someone else commented.</p><p>Someone else also agreed with the initial comment writing, “yes! Tired of hearing about Lori lol her and the mom is pimping Steve 🤣🤣🤣 I think he should spend time with the twins without them.. just saying lol.”</p><p>Another fan guessed the twins and Steve’s current wife <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Marjorie Harvey</a></strong> may not get along well.</p><p>“I don’t think they get along with her bc they don’t even follow each other smh.”</p><p>Just a few days before Steve’s post, fans began wondering about the whereabouts of the twins when they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="glimpsed a photo (opens in a new tab)">glimpsed a photo</a> op of the blended Harvey clan on a boat in Monte Carlo, Monaco.</p><p>“Where are steve twin daughters they are never on these trips.”</p><p>“Why the twins never show up?”</p><p>“Where’s the twins?</p><p>“Doesn’t Steve have other kids too? Why don’t they ever go on these ‘family’ trips?? Just asking?”</p><p>Steve didn’t acknowledge the hubbub then and didn’t on the birthday post, either. The twins didn’t comment on the chatter on their dad’s post either. They did, however, post happy birthday wishes to each other.</p><p>“God knew we would be a force in the world. I love you @iamkarliraymond,” Brandi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="said in part (opens in a new tab)">said in part</a> on her IG account.
