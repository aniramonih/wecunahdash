Dench explained, "It was very gradual and grown up. We got together, in a way, through the animals. It's just wonderful."</p><p dir=ltr>In 2010, Mills invited her to open a red squirrel enclosure at the British Wildlife Center, which he founded in 1997, per Bustle. Mills told Radio Times their relationship began as a "slow, organic friendship," which initially saw them invite each other to various events. "It's lasted because we have the same sense of humour — it's hopeless without that — and then she's passionate about wildlife, as I am about theatre and films, so we go into one another's worlds. She's a great giggler," Mills said.&nbsp;The pair even worked together on Dench's two-part ITV series "Wild Borneo Adventure" a documentary, which sees them explore the island's rainforests. But, aside from their hands-on experiences, Bustle also notes viewers "get a glimpse of her adorable relationship with Mills."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>And when the couple isn't in the tropics, they also like to keep the heat on at home. Dench told <a href=#>Woman & Home</a>&nbsp;that, despite her age, she still feels "desire." She even revealed she frequents a "lovely naughty knicker shop" in Covent Garden to keep things interesting. But, for anyone wanting to visit the store, she warns, "don't buy up everything because I'm going there!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1haYZ6e8inqqKclWK3trDIZpueppOdwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrqKsmGKxosLInWSmoZyhwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
