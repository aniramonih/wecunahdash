How healthy is the Chinese politician’s relationship with his spouse and kids? Qin Gang, a prominent Chinese diplomat and politician, currently holds the position of China’s State Councilor, having previously served as China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. He also has a history as China’s former Ambassador to the US, as well as serving as China’s deputy minister of foreign affairs from 2018 to 2021.</p><p>Gang’s name has recently been trending following his removal from the role of China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, coupled with his month-long absence from public view. With the announcement of his dismissal, questions about Gang’s personal life have surfaced, which will be detailed in this article.</p><h2>Details of Qin Gang’s Family Life</h2><p><strong>Qin Gang</strong>, born in March 1966 in Tianjin, Hebei, China, hails from a distinguished political family. Aged 57 in 2024, he prefers to keep his personal life private and has not had much information publicized about his family members.

Not much is known about their marriage due to Gang’s private nature. It is speculated that the couple may have opted for a private wedding ceremony.</p><h2>Qin Gang’s Children</h2><p><strong>Qin Gang</strong> and his wife are rumored to have a child. Reports suggest that they have a son, allegedly fathered by Gang with a TV broadcaster educated at Cambridge University, Fu Xiaotian. News outlets, including the New York Post, have hinted at the existence of a son from this relationship.
