And I called him up, and I said, ‘Hey, Josh, you want to come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys?’” Dun said. “And as we were watching, we noticed every single one of us was in our underwear. And seriously, Josh turned to me — and we were no one at that time — and he said, ‘If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win, we should receive it just like this.’”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Dun also told aspiring musicians to never give up on their dreams. “I want everyone who is watching at home to know that you could be next. So watch out, OK,” he said. “Because anyone from anywhere can do anything, and this is it.”</p><p>Twenty One Pilots are also nominated for Record of the Year for “Stressed Out” and Best Rock Performance for “Heathens.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuwnZ6pxm67zZ5kqaGcpMG0ecOiq5ygXam1prXRZqeapqSoerW7jJqanJ2gqXqovsCmpLJlp2mDd4GXcWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
