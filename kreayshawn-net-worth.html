She blamed her accountant for the financial fumble.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kreayshawn was born Natassia Gail Zolot on September 24, 1989, in San Francisco, California. Her mother, guitarist Elka Zolot, was in the punk band The Trashwomen, which formed in San Francisco in the early '90s. After Kreayshawn moved from San Francisco to East Oakland, she got her first video camera at the age of 10 and began filming her raps and documenting her life.</p><p>She attended MetWest High School, a "new alternative type of high school," and instead of taking usual high school classes, she had to spend three days a week interning at a radio station. Kreayshawn later decided that she wanted to attended a more traditional school and transferred to Oakland High School. She has said that she didn't go to class, had a 0.0 grade point average at the end of the term, and was expelled for truancy.</p><p>A few months after her expulsion, Kreayshawn enrolled at Alameda High School, but she was also expelled from that school. She then attended Island High, a continuation high school, where she finished her sophomore year. Kreayshawn later began skipping school for weeks at a time, and when she returned to the school, she discovered that it had moved and never found the new location.</p><p>When she was 16, Kreayshawn moved to Berkeley to live with her aunt. She later moved in with her friend V-Nasty, participated in a work program, and earned her GED. She started recording songs on a laptop at the age of 17 as well as filming music videos for local artists. Her videos earned her a full scholarship for the Berkeley Digital Film Institute after attracting the attention of Dean Patrick Kriwanek, and she spent two semesters there. Kreayshawn moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a career making music videos, but her manager, Chioke "Stretch" McCoy, urged to her to pursue a music career.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-160609 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Kreayshawn.jpg alt width=457 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-160609 class=wp-caption-text>FREDERIC J.

In late 2015, the IRS seized Kreayshawn's bank account due to unpaid taxes. In a now-deleted tweet, she stated that she paid her taxes but "instead of my accountant paying them he took the money for taxes and never filed and robbed me." In 2011, Kreayshawn insulted rapper <a href=# title="Rick Ross Net Worth">Rick Ross</a> during a Tinychat freestyle, calling him "fake." She later said it was a misunderstanding, but a few days later, she called him fake again and said that "he can't rap." This led to Ross and Kreayshawn getting into a shouting match backstage at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. That night nude photos of Kreayshawn were leaked due to her Twitter account being hacked, and she claimed that she was underage when the photos were taken.</p><h2 id=awards-accolades><strong>Awards and Accolades</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Kreayshawn earned an MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best New Artist for "Kreayshawn: Gucci Gucci."
