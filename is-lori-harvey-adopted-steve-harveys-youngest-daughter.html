If you ever wonder where his relationship and family wisdom comes from, the man has 7 children. But the most well-known among all is his youngest one, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lori Harvey</a></strong>, who stands tall and shines brilliantly in her own spotlight.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>While many believe that being the daughter of such an iconic figure would cast a long shadow, Lori has proven time and again that she’s not just a celebrity offspring. While her last name might open doors, Lori has come a long way and established herself as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a successful model, entrepreneur, and socialite</a>. She has walked the runway for luxury brands like&nbsp;Dolce & Gabbana and starred in campaigns for&nbsp;Burberry&nbsp;and&nbsp;Michael Kors.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Although Lori appears to have inherited not just her father’s endearing grin but his extraordinary wit and intelligence, a question often lingers about whether she is Steve’s biological daughter or not, given our comedic maestro’s elaborate relationship history. And there’s only one way to find out: diving right into the pool.</p><h2 id=h-steve-harvey-s-relationship-history data-injectable=false>Steve Harvey’s relationship history</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey once said</a> “Family is my reason why, I work to leave a legacy and hopefully [make] the world a better place for them. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Feud host</a> is currently a dad to seven children and a grandfather to seven grandchildren on top of it. But does he have biological ties to all? The short answer is, no.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Harvey had his first marriage in 1981 at the age of 24. His then-wife Marcia Harvey soon blessed his world with twin girls, Brandi and Karli in 1982. This makes Steve’s oldest biological children a little over 40 years old now. 9 years later in 1991, the couple welcomed their first son Broderick Harvey Jr., before the two separated in 1994.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Steve Harvey married for the second time in 1996 to Mary Shackelford and welcomed his second son (and fourth overall child) Wynton Harvey in 1997. However, this marriage also ended after lasting for nine years later, in 2005. But worry not, our comedic genius will get lucky again soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>For the third time, Steve Harvey found love in Marjorie Harvey and married her in 2007. This marriage also brought him a loving fatherhood of Marjorie’s three children, who she had from a previous relationship. Steve Harvey legally adopted Marjorie’s three children, including daughters Morgan and Lori, and son Jason, making him the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">father of seven children in total</a>. However, only the first four children from his first two marriages are his biological children.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Steve Harvey Lori Harvey’s real father?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>So, Lori Harvey is actually adopted and Steve is not her biological father. She was born on Jan. 13, 1997, and along with siblings Jason and Morgan, she was legally adopted by Steve after he married their mother, Marjorie, in 2007.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, there is no information available on Lori’s biological father. Since Marjorie, Lori, or Steve have never brought him up, it’s reasonable to presume that she has no personal connection to the man. Steve and Lori have a wonderful, loving, and supportive father-daughter relationship, with Lori treating Steve as her true father.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Lori has constantly been in the media eye for her relationships, from the earliest one with the Dutch football player Memphis Depay in 2016, to her most recent breakup with the British actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Damson Idris</a> making headlines currently. She has separated from Idris after almost a year of dating and the duo released a joint statement (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) confirming their split, saying:</p><p>“We are at a point in our lives where our individual paths require our full attention and dedication. We part ways remaining friends with nothing but love and respect for each other and the time we shared together.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Lori started modeling in 2015 at the age of 18 and became an entrepreneur at the age of 24 after launching her own skincare brand, SKN. The 26-year-old has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines due to various high-profile relationships</a>, with the most famous being the one with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael B. Jordan</a>. The pair started dating in Nov. 2020 before&nbsp;ultimately calling it quits in June 2022.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Throughout the thick and thin patches of her life, Steve has been a pillar of strength to her, making sure to be vocal about his love and support for his daughter. Following <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her breakup with Jordan in 2022</a>, Steve shared his thoughts on his&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;saying, “I’m team Lori, 1,000 percent. She’s my daughter. I love her, I support her.” (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a>)</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=false>So, Harvey’s got his daughter’s back whether they share blood or not. In his own words: “As long as you don’t put your hands on my daughter, I don’t give a damn what you do.” We stan a good father Steve!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnLqKmiZZiWv7ex2GaYnaegqbKledKtnK%2BdXZ2us8LEsqpmsZ%2Bqu6ix0q1knZmlnLW1sdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
