Jeff Mauro hosts the program, while Shinmin Li and Aarti Sequeira serve as judges with him.&nbsp;According to the press announcement for the show:</p><p>“Host Jeff Mauro, along with judges Shinmin Li and Aarti Sequeira, challenge these skilled bakers to create extravagant Christmas cakes inspired by humorous holiday stories.

Mauro was born in Chicago in 1978 and graduated from Bradley University in Illinois in 2000 with a degree in television and radio. While he realized his talent for being on stage at a young age and pursued performing arts, he never looked back after discovering food.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jeff-Mauro.jpeg alt="Jeff Mauro" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He fell in love with the art of producing sandwiches, salads, soups, and sauces after co-founding Prime Time Deli & Catering and honing his culinary abilities. He worked his magic in the kitchen during the day and his humor at night. Jeff wanted to combine his passion for cooking with his comic personality, so he relocated to Los Angeles. After a few years in the city, Jeff enrolled in Le Cordon Bleu to hone his talents. He returned to Chicago after graduating as valedictorian and began working as a culinary teacher, a successful private corporate chef, and a local comedian.</p><p>Jeff first debuted on the Food Network in Season 7 of Food Network Star, where he finished first. He went on to become a regular network television personality, anchoring the Emmy-nominated series Sandwich King.&nbsp;Jeff demonstrated several sandwich-making techniques to the audience throughout the performance. He also appeared on Kitchen Crash, where he raided people’s cupboards, freezers, and pantries to prepare three meals for the judges.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jeff-Mauro-1.jpg alt="Jeff Mauro" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Holiday Wars presenter has been on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Steve Harvey, Good Morning America, and the Today program, among others.&nbsp;Mauro will now serve as the presenter of the Food Network’s Holiday Wars.
