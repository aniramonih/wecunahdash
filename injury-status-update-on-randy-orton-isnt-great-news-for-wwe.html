According to a <a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful Select</a> report, Orton “required a fusion in his lower back that would keep him out of action for an extended period of time.” The report notes that the surgery has already taken place and they add, “there were some in WWE that told us they’d be fortunate to have him back after such a long career and the significance of the injury."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Orton's situation is being viewed by some in WWE as one that may never allow him to return to the ring is unfortunate. The belief at the time he was ruled out was that he would eventually be back, but the buildup of problems and the severity of the issues now better known might have turned into news that Orton risking a comeback might not be in the cards. A return shouldn't be ruled out, but this is something that all parties are watching and WWE is aware that this could be it for The Viper.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# style=display:inline!important title="Why Randy Orton Is The Best Wrestler In WWE Survivor Series History&nbsp;">Why Randy Orton Is The Best Wrestler In WWE Survivor Series History</a></span></p><p>There is currently no timetable for his return and thus there are no creative plans, adds Fightful's report. His current WWE contract expires in 2024 and while WWE could extend or freeze the contract due to his injury, it's not clear if they are going to do so. Riddle has already seemingly moved on and found a new partner in Elias and there have been no updates as to whether Orton will be involved in any capacity in events like The Royal Rumble or next year's WrestleMania.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-39-s-hope-this-isn-39-t-it-for-orton>Let's Hope This Isn't It For Orton</h2><p>Fans should remain optimistic that this won't be the end of Orton's career. If it is, he's had a legendary run and will be a sure bet for the WWE Hall of Fame, but it won't be how he'd like to go out. And, wrestlers have returned from career-threatening injuries before, so it's way too soon to rule Orton out at this point.</p><p><strong>TheSportster Podcast has returned!
