Mary said:</p><p>“When we were in Bali, we were very relaxed and had a great time, We were just in a very zen state of mind, and it was just incredible. We were so excited and I really didn’t think about the possibility — I should have — but I didn’t really think about the possibility of the pregnancy not going through.”</p><p>She explains:</p><p>“I’m not really in it [the season] quite as much and around the other girls, and I just removed myself from stressful situations, Instead of being in the middle, mediating everybody else’s problems, I took a step back from being a manager.”</p><p>“I just reduced the stress in my life and made sure I was lightly working out. Didn’t want to overdo it, but getting an exercise, eating very healthy, did a lot of yoga and meditation. It was just trying to take care of myself as best as possible.”</p><p>Mary says that her husband helped her get through the hard time that followed which included a septic miscarriage, which is an infection in the uterus that happens one to two days after the loss. The reality star had to have a surgery called dilation and curettage (D&C), which takes out tissue from inside the uterus.</p><p>She says:</p><p>“I can’t ask for a better partner, He’s just very, very thoughtful and sensitive to the whole situation, and he just tried to take care of me the best [way] possible, and I’m like, honey, you’re going through this too.”</p><p>Recently in an Instagram post, she appreciate the support of her fans during this difficult time:</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> for more information related to other stars’ kids, family and other updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnxxgI6doJ1lnZa%2FunnBqKWnnaRitaLCxGaYZpqRl8Zw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
