Great TV though!”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Brad Kelly’s Troubles Off-Screen</strong></h3><p>Brad Kelly’s troubles extended beyond the on-screen drama. In February 2022, he found himself in a serious predicament. According to TMZ, Brad was arrested following a domestic dispute. Police reports obtained by the publication indicate that Kelly told officers the woman involved had fallen and hit her head on a table. Despite his explanation, he was arrested and charged with second-degree assault involving domestic violence.</p><p>Facing Legal Consequences Kelly’s attorney, Jon-Marc Petersen, disclosed that his client had pleaded guilty to felony assault, leading to the dropping of the remaining charges. Brad Kelly was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison, with three of those years suspended. Petersen suggested that, if Kelly maintains good behavior, he might be released after serving eight months behind bars.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Uncertainty Surrounding His Future on Bering Sea Gold While the legal consequences of Brad Kelly’s actions have been determined, his future on Bering Sea Gold remains uncertain.
