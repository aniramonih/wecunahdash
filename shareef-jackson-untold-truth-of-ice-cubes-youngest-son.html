As earlier stated, he was born on the 17th of November in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, to his parents Ice Cube whose real name is O’Shea Jackson Sr., and Kimberly Woodruff. His birth sign is Scorpio; he is an American by nationality and is of African-American ethnicity.</p><p>His parents practice the Islamic religion, and everyone in the family have followed the same religion. Shareef was raised by his parents in a comfortable home where he was privileged to enjoy all the luxuries a child would need to grow, including a good education. Although the name of the schools he graduated from is not known, Shareef is reportedly a graduate of a private university in California.</p><p>Shareef shares his father’s love and passion for basketball. He often goes with him to the stadium to watch NBA games. Other than this, there is no further insight into what Shareef does for a living. Unlike some of his other siblings, he is a private person and does not have a presence on any special media platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Sha.jpg><h2><strong>Shareef Jackson is the Son of Famous Entertainers</strong></h2><p>Shareef was born into a family of entertainers. His father, O’Shea Jackson Sr., professionally known as Ice Cube, is one of the most famous rappers in the American music scene. O’Shea Jackson Sr. first started his career as a hip-hop singer and was part of the now-defunct C.I.A, a rap group made up of the rap trio Ice Cube, Sir Jinx, and K-Dee.</p><p>Ice Cube left the group as a result of some financial differences, and in 1990 he released his debut solo studio album, AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted. Today, he has ten studio albums in his name, which include Death Certificate, The Predator, Lethal Injection, War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc), War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc), Laugh Now, Cry Later, Raw Footage, I Am the West, and Everythang’s Corrupt.</p><p>Shareef’s father is also a well-recognized actor and has starred in a good number of movies and TV shows such as The Players Club, Friday After Next, Are We There Yet? Straight Outta Compton, First Sunday, The Sinbad Show, WrestleMania 21, 30 For 30, and many others. On the other hand, Shareef’s mother, Kimberly Woodruff, is not in the entertainment circle. She is a philanthropist and charity worker.</p><h2><strong>His Parents Have Been Married Since 1992</strong></h2><p>Shareef’s parents’ marriage is one of the longstanding celebrity marriages,, and it is a feat that not many celebrities are able to accomplish. The duo met for the first time when Ice Cube was still trying to gain recognition as a rapper in the music industry, and Kimberly was a college student. Meanwhile, Kimberly was then in a relationship with another man, but that did not hinder Ice Cube from admiring her beauty and personality.</p><p>They parted ways without speaking to each other, but after six months, they coincidentally ran into each other again, and this time, Kimberly had already quit her relationship and was single. They went on to become friends, and after a while, the rapper asked her on a date which she accepted. Ice Cube and Kimberly officially started dating in 1988, and their love is seen as one made in heaven.</p><p>Three years later, in 1991, they got engaged, and on 26th May 1992, the couple sealed their love in a simple wedding ceremony which had in attendance their family members and close friends. Shareef Jackson’s parents have since remained married, and their marriage has today lasted for over three decades. They live together happily with their children, and there has been no record of rumors, scandals, or controversies surrounding their union.</p><p>Talking about what has sustained their marriage for 31 years, Shareef’s father once revealed that constant communication is the magic; which has been proven to be one of the bones of a successful relationship/marriage. Even though they have been married for a long time, their love has remained strong and never faded one bit.</p><p>After four grown-up children and many years in marriage, Shareef’s parents still profess their love for each other at every given opportunity. The couple is obviously transferring the love they share to their children, as they all share a close bond in the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Shareef-Jackson-and-his-parents-and-siblings.png><h2><strong>Shareef has Two Elder Brothers and Two Elder Sisters&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As stated, Shareef Jackson is the youngest child of Ice Cube, which means he is not his only child. He has four siblings alongside whom he grew up; two brothers and two sisters named O’Shea Jackson Jr, Darell, Deja, and Karima. His two sisters, Deja and Karima, are twins.</p><p>Shareef’s oldest brother, O’Shea Jackson Jr., born on 24th February 1991, is following in his father’s footsteps as an actor and singer. He made his acting debut in 2009 in Janky Promoter, a movie produced by his father, where he had a cameo appearance. He got his breakthrough as an actor in the 2015 movie&nbsp;Straight Outta Compton. As an artist, O’Shea Jr. has dropped a few singles under the stage name OhMyGoodness (OMG).</p><p>Shareef’s other brother, Darell Jackson, was born on 22nd December 1992.

As for the twin girls, Deja and Karima, they are not in the entertainment circle.</p><p>While Deja is a basketball player, Karima focuses more on her academics. She is a holder of two master’s degrees and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Public Affairs and Administration at Rutgers University. Moreso, she works as a research assistant at Rutgers University and is also a philanthropist, just like her mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmrKCRp7KmsoyjmJyjo6S7bsHNraalnF2pv7bAx2amn2WZmLJur9SbnKxlqaTCr7PErKtmq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
