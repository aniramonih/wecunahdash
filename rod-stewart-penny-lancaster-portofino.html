They no doubt toasted 68-year-old singer Rod's recent chart success. His new self-penned album shot to the top of the charts making it his first number one album in 34 years. It is the first collection of original songs that the hitmaker has released in more than 20 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/69e437e0a060-rod-stewart2-a.jpg><p id=eDRUgI6-hySu data-wc=129>As well as enjoying a romantic meal on board the luxury vessel, the pair have also been spotted in the gorgeous town's cafes and boutique shops. There was no sign of their two children Alastair, seven, and three-year-old Aiden. The trip will have brought back memories for the pair who married nearby in 2007. After an eight year courtship, the pair tied the knot in a quintessential Italian Riviera village just along the coast from A-list favourite Portofino. <strong>HELLO!</strong> magazine exclusively featured the intimate nuptials which took place in a medieval former monastery built on a cliff top overlooking spectacular views of the coastline. Rod's new album features 11 original tracks penned by the star, as well as a cover of Tom Waits' .</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d6e7025be046-rod-stewart1-a.jpg><p id=e00MAXvgIK_2 data-wc=197>Rod said he chose to include the song because it reminded him of the brief time he separated from photographer Penny. "Penny and I broke up for two weeks and the song is about that time," said the chart topper. "I asked her for a photo of herself in a frame so that I could see her when I went to bed and when I woke up." Reflecting on his musical legacy Rod added, "There was a point in my career where I'd given up on song writing because I didn't think I had anything to say and I was getting lazy... then I realised I had a lot to write about." The LP is also produced by the star. <strong>HELLO!</strong> had the pleasure of Rod and Penny's company at their 25th anniversary party last week where Rod performed his version of Happy Birthday in honour of the magazine. "The thing I love about <strong>HELLO!</strong> is that it is a class act in every respect," said Penny at the party. "It's great to be treated with dignity and respect and that's why <strong>HELLO!</strong> has been going for 25 years," added rocker Rod.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
