Plus, Chris Jericho will face Matt Sydal after Sydal issued the challenge on Wednesday. Elsewhere on the show, Penta El Zero Miedo will clash with Anthony Henry, and Kris Statlander will battle Queen Aminata.</p><p>The results are as follows:</p><p>In the opening match, Jericho made relatively short work of Sydal. After catching a powerbomb early, Jericho would flip momentum back into his favor with a Codebreaker for a near fall. In the end, Jericho countered a big splash attempt from Sydal late, throwing his opponent to the ground and then hitting the Judas Effect for the win.</p><p>After the match, Don Callis ran away from the commentary area, and Konosuke Takeshita appeared to attack Jericho, kickstarting a massive brawl that had to be broken up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>This one was over pretty quickly, as Penta got taken down by some good moves early but flipped the script almost immediately. In the end, Henry missed a double stomp jump from the top rope, and that allowed Penta to hit the Fear Factor for a quick win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The two women are arguing backstage while Renee Paquette tries to wrangle them for an interview. Ruby shoves Harley Cameron and asks why she kissed Angelo Parker, to which Cameron admits it was Anna Jay who put her up to it, with Saraya eventually agreeing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Statlander was able to walk away with a big win despite Aminata looking like she would come out on top early. After hitting Statlander with a diving crossbody, Aminata tried to pin her but Kris kicked out. Statlander would eventually end things by hitting a massive spinning move for the pin and win.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Lethal told Sonjay Dutt that they need to focus on what All Elite Wrestling is about, which is good old-fashioned action in the ring. Dutt says that perhaps kicking Karen Jarrett out of the group would help that, but Lethal says he doesn’t wanna argue over stupid things.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Statlander was joined by Stokely Hathaway, and after a minute Willow Nightingale showed up to accuse someone of sabotaging her travel gear. Stokley and Willow went back and forth for a bit, and Statlander was clearly not sure how to handle the situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In a surprisingly brutal match for AEW Rampage, Hardy and Allin absolutely gave it their all and put on a show to close out the night. Things started with Allin diving over the ropes and onto Jeff outside of the ring and only got crazier from there. Later in the match, Hardy tried to use the outside stairs to land a big splash, but Allin avoided it and sent Hardy through the barricade.&nbsp;</p><p>Things came to an end in a massive back-and-forth, as Hardy threw Allin into a ringpost and set him up on a table outside of the ring. However, Hardy sent himself through the table instead as he failed a Swanton Bomb attempt, allowing Allin to try a Coffin Drop, which also got countered. Hardy then tried to end it with a Twist of Fate, but Darby countered that and quickly rolled up Jeff for the win.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsb2lrYGKupsOMq5imqJGcsm6%2BxKyspayjYn5ufZhmaW1lmpqzp3nHmqmdsV2ZrrOu2GaYpaSZo3qktNGiqmailae2pLTOZqCnZZGYwaq7zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
