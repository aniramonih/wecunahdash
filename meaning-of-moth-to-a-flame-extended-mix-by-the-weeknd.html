It brings to light the complexities of human emotions and the confusion that can arise when one's heart is pulled in different directions.In addition to the overarching theme of desire and emotional infidelity, 'Moth to a Flame' also explores the concept of dependency and the idea that some relationships may contribute to a sense of imprisonment.
