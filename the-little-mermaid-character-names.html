The infamous sea witch Ursula is well-remembered by audiences, yet ultimately unlikable despite her status as a notable antagonist.</p><p>In contrast, characters like Flounder and Grimsby are far more endearing because they actually care about and assist their pals. The Little Mermaid features a number of enduring characters that viewers adore as well as other characters that viewers may not particularly like.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Ariel</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Chef Louis</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Eric</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Flotsam And Jetsam</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Flounder</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Grimsby</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> King Triton</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Scuttle</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Sebastian</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Ursula</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Ariel>Ariel<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ariel-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Ariel is charming and daring. She yearned to enter a society wholly distinct from her own. She liked her friends and her family, but because of her rebelliousness and impulsiveness, she tended to behave like the sixteen-year-old she was. Ariel’s hasty decision to strike a deal with Ursula put her companions in a difficult situation where they had to support her or watch her suffer a horrific fate. She also failed to inform her family of her whereabouts, causing them worry.</p><p>It took a while for her and her father to mend their connection, but they eventually did. Ariel is incredibly loving, but she can also be a little self-centered at times, especially if it puts those who care about her in a tough situation.</p><h3><span id=Chef_Louis>Chef Louis</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Chef-Louis-Cropped-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chef Louis was initially only doing his job, but his frightening dedication to pursuing Sebastian and refusal to let him flee was a little excessive. Poor Sebastian didn’t intend to become supper, and Louis almost immediately becomes fixated on catching him. Louis takes his profession seriously, but spectators find him less endearing because of his conflict with Sebastian. Who enjoys a character who attempts to slaughter and prepare another character as food?</p><p>It makes sense why he and Sebastian are rivals.</p><h3><span id=Eric>Eric</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Eric-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Eric is a good man from the bottom of his heart. He put his life at danger in order to return and save his dog Max from the burning and sinking ship. He cares about his realm and is kind to everyone around him.</p><p>He patiently found alternative ways to get to know Ariel instead of getting angry because she couldn’t talk. Even after learning that Ariel was actually a mermaid, Eric pursued her and ended Ursula’s life to save her. He is a hero, thoughtful, compassionate, and courageous.</p><h3><span id=Flotsam_And_Jetsam>Flotsam And Jetsam</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/flotsam-and-jetsam.jpg alt width=1000 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These two of Ursula’s nasty henchmen are not only unsettling, but also perilous. They actively seek for possible victims, which is how Ursula adds Ariel to her clientele. When Ariel was most open to being contacted, they persuaded her to ask Ursula for assistance.</p><p>Even though they lack Ursula’s superhuman abilities, they are cunning and deceitful just like her. They attempt to drown Eric near the conclusion of the movie, but Flounder and Sebastian stop them. Even if they were capable of terrible things, rest assured that they met their ends before the movie’s finale and were rendered powerless.</p><h3><span id=Flounder>Flounder</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Flounder-Cropped-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>One of the few people who are aware of Ariel’s affection for humans and her collection of human items is Flounder, her best friend and someone who is always there for her. He assists Ariel as she searches a shipwreck for additional treasures at the opening of the movie. He has a tendency to worry excessively, although Flounder was justified in being concerned about sharks in the shipwreck scenario.</p><p>Even after Ariel is transformed into a human, he stays close by and offers any assistance he can to make sure Ariel stays a human and doesn’t end up permanently belonging to Ursula. He is a wonderful best buddy that is lovely and humorous.</p><h3><span id=Grimsby>Grimsby</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Grimsby-Cropped-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Grimsby in The Little Mermaid grinning and holding a fork Grimsby acts as a father figure to Eric, watching out for him and correcting him when necessary. Typically, he is the one to bring Eric back to reality. For example, he persuades Eric to embrace Ariel and let go of the lady he is fixated on discovering.</p><p>When Ariel misuses his pipe and smoke gets in his face, Grimsby isn’t at all irritated. He’s friendly and always looks out for Eric’s interests, whether that means assisting with his recovery or encouraging him to find a marriage.</p><h3><span id=King_Triton>King Triton</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disney-little-mermaid-king-triton-ariel-grotto-eric-statue-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>King Triton has a narrow perspective on people. He won’t accept that they are anything but evil and prevents Ariel from ever speaking to them. Despite his best efforts to keep her safe, he doesn’t actually talk to his youngest daughter. Unfortunately, a terrible thing happens between them when he, in a fit of wrath, obliterates all the human things she had gathered in her grotto, including her recently acquired statue of Eric.</p><p>Only after Ariel disappears does King Triton show a more sympathetic side, expressing regret and concern for her safety before granting her wish to become human. Although he’s not the audience’s favourite character, he’s also not the least liked.</p><h3><span id=Scuttle>Scuttle<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ariel-Meets-With-Scuttle-In-The-Little-Mermaid-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Not always was Scuttle the smartest. He undoubtedly mistook what a fork was, which put Ariel in a difficult situation when she later used her fork to brush her hair while eating with Eric. He had a tendency to be brash and noisy, and he wasn’t always alert to warning indications.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was a wonderful friend and attempted to assist Ariel in any way he could, delaying Eric and Vanessa’s nuptials until Ariel could join the ship. Although he is a terrific ally, he struggles with nuance.</p><h3><span id=Sebastian>Sebastian<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sebastian-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The poor crab was certainly under stress because he had to balance trying to uphold his fidelity to King Triton with trying to keep Ariel out of mischief. Ariel wasn’t too pleased with Sebastian after King Triton damaged the riches in her grotto, but Sebastian made it his duty to watch over her despite being given the tough task of continually keeping an eye on her.</p><p>He eventually became into one of her closest allies and companions. He struggled mightily to prevent becoming dinner himself! What was not to love about Sebastian? He was amusing and clever.</p><h3><span id=Ursula>Ursula</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ursula-little-mermaid-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Especially when it’s Ursula, the villain isn’t always the most likeable. She is calculating, selfish, and brutal. She deceives the merpeople into forming agreements with her, and if they don’t keep their part of the bargain, they are permanently her property.</p><p>Given that Ursula tried to set Ariel up for failure by posing as Vanessa and using a spell on Eric, it is logical to assume that she has also done that to her past clients. She also attempted to rule the entire ocean after going completely insane with power after obtaining King Triton’s trident. There wasn’t much to like about Ursula.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
