The encounter took place at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) more than a week ago, and the man was in close proximity to a number of high-profile political figures including Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner, and Mark Meadows. Little is known about Coronavirus and how it is transmitted. With influenza, it is known the flu is spread through droplets that are spread through contacts such as sneezing and coughing. At this point, it is unclear whether Coronavirus is transmitted the same way or could be transmitted airborne. If Coronavirus can be transmitted airborne, that would mean the distance between people could cause it to spread easier than with the flu.</p><p>For example, with the common flu, it is recommended to stay approximately six feet away to prevent transmission via coughing or sneezing. Additionally, using a tissue to sneeze in or coughing in the crook of your arm keeps those droplets from spreading to others.</p><p>If the Coronavirus can be transmitted airborne, without a sick person coughing or sneezing, the transmission would occur at higher rates, and the six-foot rule wouldn’t be foolproof.</p><p>It is also unknown how long a person with Coronavirus remains contagious — even after symptoms are gone or how long the virus can survive on objects.</p><p>Ted Cruz took the Coronavirus seriously before learning he had come into close contact with a patient and said that he feels well, but will stay home for the next two weeks to self-quarantine.</p><p>You may see the statement that Ted Cruz released on Twitter below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today I released the following statement: <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/XGXEa4ozcg</a></p><p>— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 8, 2020</a></p><p>At this point, the Department of Health recommends people who have symptoms of Coronavirus not to go to their doctors’ office or emergency room, where they could easily spread the virus to others, but to contact their local state department of health branch for their area.</p><p>However, many people who have followed the Department of Health’s guidelines are finding difficulty getting tested according to reports and accounts that are pouring in to social media networks.</p><p>If you have symptoms of Coronavirus, contact your doctor via phone and your local Department of Health for assistance.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates on Ted Cruz’s condition as he self-quarantines due to Coronavirus.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekmrFur9GusWasn2LAprjFZqiumaKWu7W1zZ5kmp6kmr9ur86moKefXZ67bq%2FOp6uam6RixKrAx2aaqKqfo663tdGuqmaokam2prrTZpitZZOlrqR5knBtb2plZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
