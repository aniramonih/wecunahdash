Peter Thiel and&nbsp;Matt Danzeisen got married on October 2017 and share a daughter together.</strong></p><p>Most notable personalities in America avoid being too political but Peter Thiel has no such hesitation. The ace investor and billionaire co-founder of PayPal is a conservative-libertarian and has courted major controversy over the years with some of his views. He also raised a lot of eyebrows with his public show of support for Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 American presidential election.</p><p>Thiel remains undaunted and continues pursuing his various groundbreaking investments. One person who has been of great help to him in his endeavors is his husband, Matt Danzeisen. A Cornell alum and investment expert, Danzeisen holds the position of head of private investments at Thiel Capital. He and Thiel were together for nearly two decades before tying the knot in 2017. They now have a daughter together and co-own some companies as well.</p><h4><strong>Profile Summary of Matt Danzeisen</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Matt Danzeisen</li><li><strong>Year of birth:</strong> 1967</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 56 years</li><li><strong>Education institutions attended:</strong> Cornell University</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> finance and investment guru</li><li><strong>Spouse:</strong> Peter Thiel (m. 2017)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> one daughter</li></ul><h2><strong>Matt Danzeisen is an Alum of Cornell University</strong></h2><p>Not a whole lot of personal details exist about Matt Danzeisen but some things are obvious, including the fact that he is an American citizen and has Caucasian ethnicity. With regards to his age, Matt Danzeisen is about 58, years old using the time that he graduated from college to make an intelligent estimation.</p><p>Danzeisen attended Cornell University New York from 1995 to 1999. He majored in economics/finance and completed his degree successfully. Upon doing so, he went the extra mile of becoming a CFA chart holder.</p><p>These are chartered financial analysts who are committed to a higher standard of excellence. They apply their knowledge and skills in a wide range of positions throughout the global finance industry and are highly sought-after as investment management professionals.</p><p>For one to become a CFA, they need to satisfy the education and work requirements; pass the CFA exam; become a member of the CFA Institute, and abide by the code of ethics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/12/Matt-Danzeisen.jpg><h2><strong>Matt Danzeisen and Peter Thiel Began Dating in the Mid 2000s</strong></h2><p>Beyond his work at Thiel Capital, another thing that ties Matt Danzeisen to the company is that he is married to its billionaire founder, Peter Thiel. Thiel is originally from Germany but grew up in the U.S. He obtained a law degree from Stanford University in 1992.</p><p>Thiel spent some time in the 90s practicing the legal professional. He later delved into the finance and securities aspect of things and this later inspired him to join hands with two of his pals to create the foremost online payment company, PayPal, in 1998. PayPal turned out to be a huge success and by 2002, Thiel and his co-founders sold the company for $1.5 billion.</p><p>With his share of the profits, Peter Thiel has established himself as one of the foremost tech investors in America. His investment firm has variously staked money on companies such as Airbnb, Stripe, Affirm, SpaceX, and Facebook (his 10.2% stake in Facebook cost him $500,000 in 2004 and he sold the same for over $1 billion in 2012).</p><p>Thiel now has a net worth of $4.7 billion and is one of the richest men in America. He has also been making waves with his political views, some of which are controversial.</p><p>Matt Danzeisen and Peter Thiel first met each other in the mid-2000s. At that time, Danzeisen was working for Blackrock while Thiel had already sold off PayPal and was making great strides as an investor.</p><p>They took a shine to each other and started dating. Thiel thereafter convinced Danzeisen to come work for him at Thiel Capital in 2008. The couple initially kept their relationship low key but a series of publications by defunct gossip blog, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Gawker</a>, commented on them between 2007 and 2008.</p><p>Thiel was none too happy with the fact that Gawker basically outed him as gay and demanded some sort of contrition. The blog however remained obstinate and maintained that it was an open secret.</p><p>The PayPal founder was not pleased with this and bided his time until 2012 when Gawker published a sex tape of retired WWE star, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Hulk Hogan</a>. The wrestler sued them for violation of privacy and Thiel bankrolled the trial. At the end of the day, Hogan was awarded about $140 million in compensation and this drove Gawker into bankruptcy.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Wed in 2017 and Now Have a Daughter Together</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/12/Matt-Danzeisen-2.jpg><p>Matt Danzeisen and Peter Thiel were in a steady relationship for about two decades before deciding to formalize their vows. The wedding took place in Vienna, Austria, in October 2017 and guests initially thought that the ceremony was a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>50th birthday</a> celebration for Thiel.</p><p>It however turned out to be something else entirely but they nevertheless shared in the couple’s joy. Danzeisen and Thiel are yet to comment publicly on their nuptials. They are rather happy to be living their private life, making their home in places such as Los Angeles and New Zealand.</p><p>Matt Danzeisen and Peter Thiel have one child together, a daughter. As is the couple’s M.O., they have been tight-lipped about the whole thing and there are no available details about their daughter’s name or the circumstances of her birth.</p><p>Of course, given that they are a same-sex couple, their daughter may be adopted or maybe as a result of surrogacy birth. The coming of the little one has raised some eyebrows.</p><p>Peter Thiel previously <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>stated</a> that he believes children should have a father and mother and since that isn’t possible with gay couples, he won’t be having kids. He has obviously had a change of heart and this may have been inspired by the love that he and Danzeisen share.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#EXCLUSIVE</a> | US billionaire Peter Thiel proposes luxury lodge <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#HeraldPremium</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xnYp45eG6i</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mB97aMqDAG</a></p><p>— nzherald (@nzherald) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2021</a></p><h2><strong>He is the Head of Private Investments at Thiel Capital</strong></h2><p>Matt Danzeisen currently works at the foremost investment firm, Thiel Capital.

(alternative investment platforms for retail investors and their advisors), and Coru Holdings Ltd (a financial management platform for individuals).</p><p>Danzeisen’s time at Thiel Capital has also seen him co-found the private equity investment firm known as Crescendo Equity Partners. The company was established in 2012 and has deployed over half a billion dollars in South Korea and Southeast Asian companies with a focus on the technology supply chain.</p><p>Given his array of responsibilities, Matt Danzeisen is not only one of the head honchos at Thiel Capital but is now an industry leader in investment. In 2017, he was selected as one of the speakers at the New Economy Summit in Tokyo. He addressed concerns about dwindling investment in fintech and predicted that the sector will bounce back.</p><h3><strong>Peter Thiel and His Husband, </strong><strong>Matt Danzeisen,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Co-Own the New Zealand–Based Company, Second Star Limited</strong></h3><p>Asides from their long-term romantic involvement, Matt Danzeisen and Peter Thiel have also gone into business together.
