And, recently, Allen has revealed that marrying Soon-Yi Previn was for 'strictly financial reasons.'</span></p><p><span>In his autobiographical book entitled&nbsp;"Apropos of Nothing,"&nbsp;he has mentioned that neither he nor Soon-Yi had a great need to formalize their relationship. He has written that the no-contract was worth whether it's printed on paper or else if the parties were not happy with each other.</span></p><p><span>He further wrote that:</span></p><p><span><strong>"We loved each other and there was no need to resort to the legislature. We would definitely not wed, and that was that. And then we married. Why? Not for romantic reasons but strictly financial.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Allen referred to Soon-Yi, with whom he shared the married life despite their 35 years of the age gap and continued:</span></p><p><span><strong>"I adored Soon-Yi and knew I was much older and could drop dead at a moment’s notice. If I did, I wanted her to be legally protected, to get all I owned automatically with no hitches.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Soon-Yi Previn, who is married to Woody Allen for twenty-two years, is an adopted daughter of Woody's ex-wife, Mia Farrow, and her second husband, the late composer Andre Previn.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Soon-Yi Previn And Woody Allen's Love Story</strong></span></h2><p><span>Woody Allen's relationship with Soon-Yi Previn sparked in September&nbsp;1991 after the New York Times covered an article about his affair with Mia Farrow, Soon-Yi's mother. They grew close and initiated their relationship despite Soon-Yi being the daughter of his ex-wife.</span></p><p><span>Allen was in the mid-50s, whereas Soon-Yi was just 21 when they started dating, and it brought a series of controversies regarding their huge age difference of 35 years. But it appears that his wife (at the time), Mia Farrow was unaware of his affair with Soon-Yi. Mia got devastated after finding her adopted daughter's nude pictures at Allen's home in January 1992.</span></p><p><span>However, Allen mentioned that he had no doubt and bad feelings about his relationship with Soon-Yi as he thought her (Soon) not as his daughter, but only Mia's. Similarly, Soon-Yi, too, mentioned that she had looked Woody Allen as a mother's boyfriend, never her stepfather.</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/woody-allen-soon-yi-previn-1992.jpg alt width=650 height=484 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn in 1992 (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">insider.com</a>)</span></p><p><span>Regardless of the controversies amongst the family, Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn shared their wedding vows secretly in 1997 in a small ceremony in Venice, Italy. The couple is together for twenty-two years and has adopted two children, namely&nbsp;Bechet and Manzie, since then.</span></p><p><span>Woody Allen also has a biological son named Ronan Seamus Farrow&nbsp;from his relationship with Mia Farrow. However, Woody and Ronan do not enclose an intimate bond due to his (Woody) marital status with Soon-Yi Previn, Ronan's step-sister.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Who Is Woody Allen?
