He went to William Cullen Bryant High School for free because of a basketball grant.</p><h2>The Early Influences: DJ Eric B.’s Musical Beginnings</h2><p><strong>Eric B. began deejaying at a roller rink with his younger brother and two other friends.</strong> He says that DJ Vernon, King Charles and Grandmaster Flash were some of his early inspirations. By 1985, Eric B. was a DJ at the New York radio station WBLS.</p><p>He was looking for a rapper to rap over his DJing, which is how he met Rakim.
