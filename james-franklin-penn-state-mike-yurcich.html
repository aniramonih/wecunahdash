The staff has been extremely high on O’Brien, who previously served as an analyst. Franklin said he’ll be sure he’s in every quarterback meeting this week.</p><p>Tight ends coach Ty Howle and running backs coach Ja’Juan Seider, who both entered the 2023 season with the title of co-offensive coordinator, will work together to game plan and call plays the rest of the season. Franklin said the two work well together and already have been “very collaborative.” How the actual play-calling process plays out is something Penn State is working through this week.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Franklin said he already has a list of potential coordinator candidates that he’ll begin working through. While he’d like to have a replacement hired sooner rather than later, he said the focus remains on finishing out the rest of the season strong.</p><p>The timing of this move could potentially give Penn State a bit of an advantage. Franklin was able to hire defensive coordinator Manny Diaz ahead of the team’s bowl trip a few years ago and also had former offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca in place prior to the Cotton Bowl in the 2019 season. The sooner the new coordinator can start to evaluate the roster the better.</p><p>Franklin is looking for a coordinator who can help elevate the program into the top tier of college football.</p><p>“We need to play well and we need to play well against our tougher opponents,” Franklin said. “(I’m looking for) somebody that’s going to put us in the best position to play our best football when it’s needed most, against the best competition.”</p><p>Franklin said quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=l3RM8Ec93ryPA118 href=#>Drew Allar</a> will not be involved in the hiring process but that he will factor in Allar’s skill set&nbsp;to make sure the next system fits the quarterback.</p><p>(Photo: G Fiume / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGltaWxmbnxzfJFsZmppX2aAcLbAppysZZanrq%2B3y6KlZqiVo7tuv9Oaq55lnZ64pnnYrqmcoZOdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
