Four years later, her sextuplets – three sons and three daughters – joined the family.</p><p>With such a large brood, the Gosselins were the perfect candidates for NBC’s home makeover series, Home Delivery, in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Their own show, Jon & Kate Plus 8, ran for several seasons until their marriage ended. The family was paid an undisclosed sum and reportedly received free cosmetic perks, such as a tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) for Kate, and Jon’s hair transplant.</p><p>There were also reports that Kate was raking in $40,000 per episode of Kate Plus 8, and $500,000 for Dancing With The Stars. Gosselin, however, never confirmed the figures.</p><p>She admitted that much of her earnings are placed towards a college fund for her children.</p><p>Despite fewer years as a <a href=#>TLC star,</a> her fellow TV personalities Kody Brown (Sister Wives) and Jeremy Roloff (Little People, Big World), have higher net worths.

Her two eldest children, Cara and Mady, 21, are living at their respective colleges, while Jon obtained custody of Hannah and Collin.</p><p>Her dating life was documented in 2019’s <a href=#>Kate Plus Date</a>; a second season has yet to be renewed and with a lack of updates on social media, we can only assume her quest to find The One continues or has opted to keep things private this time around.</p><p><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46wn5qsXZ7AbrfArZxmn5%2BowKa4yKeqZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2aZlqmys3mQb2SynZGnwG61zWapnpmcnsG6edOv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
