Because of this, he is no longer a senator and has chosen to move to Russia.</p><p>The Daily Caller, a conservative media outlet, published a video purporting to show a congressional staff worker having sex with an anonymous guy in the Senate chamber, which sparked the sex scandal involving Maese-Czeropski.</p><p>This video allegedly made the rounds of a closed Facebook group for homosexual guys in politics. Later, Maese-Czeropski—a Cardin legislative assistant—was named by other conservative media outlets as one of the participants in the video.</p><p>Maese-Czeropski was fired from the Senate, according to a statement released on Saturday by Cardin’s office, even though NBC News was unable to verify the authenticity of the video or the participants’ identities.</p><p>We will not provide further comments on this personal matter,” stated the release.</p><p>Maese-Czeropski himself has refuted the accusations against him. In a LinkedIn post on Friday night, he acknowledged having displayed “poor judgment” in the past but affirmed that he would “never demean his workplace.” He also claimed to be targeted for his relationships to advance a specific political agenda.</p><p>“While some of my past actions may demonstrate poor judgment, I love my job, and I will never demean my workplace,” he asserted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maese-czeropski-reactions-to-the-video><strong>Maese Czeropski reactions to the video</strong></h2><p>Maese-Czeropski moved to Russia once the sex scandal came to light. He expressed his sense of improved safety in Russia and acknowledged the difficulties of the decision.<br>He apologized to the Russian people for the belligerent attitude that some American elites had taken.</p><p>“I’m still a bit confused, but I feel very good,” Maese-Czeropski conveyed to Sputnik, a Russian media outlet supporting President Vladimir Putin, while seated with Maria Butina, a Russian agent formerly imprisoned in the U.S. and now a member of the Russian parliament.</p><p>“I feel very surrounded by protection and security,” he added.</p><p>Maese-Czeropski expressed a wish to live in both nations, although she also admitted that she might choose to stay in Russia alone. That’s alright, he said.</p><p>The Maese-Czeropski sex scandal joins the long list of comparable events in American political history that have impacted the reputations and careers of people like Anthony Weiner, Wayne Hays, Gary Condit, and others, and frequently spark intense social outrage.</p><p>source: <a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span> <span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdlralrc1mpJqdo5p6pMbEq6apq5ueerSxzZqrnmWjqa6nssSrZJ%2Bhopqxbq3FrZyrZZWtva21wqKrZquYpMSmsIyup2ahnmK3trDInKCaqqlisLC5zKKrrZ2VZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
