Recommended Videos Below is a selection of some of the greatest (and most inebriating) Bond drink orders ever.
One pint of Canadian Club Blended Rye Whiskey While it’s not the most elaborate beverage Bond ever ordered, he was certainly fond of his whiskies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the novel version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. No</a>, Bond undergoes days of intense physical training before taking on the master criminal. Each night, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bond went to the icebox and took a pint of Canadian Club Blended Rye and some ice and soda-water and went and sat in the garden and watched the last light flame and die</a>.” Even after plowing through a pint of the stuff, Bond still somehow manages to wake up fresh the next morning.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Taittinger champagne (multiple glasses)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/drink2.png><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Bond gets through a lot of champagne in the books. Though Bollinger and Dom Pérignon are his more famous tipples, Bond seems to prefer Tattinger. Enjoying a date with fellow agent Vesper Lynd in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Casino Royale</a>, Bond confesses that it is “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not a well-known brand, but it is probably the finest champagne in the world</a>.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>So many glasses of the stuff are consumed throughout the books that it would take too long to list them all. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Fleming</a> himself enjoyed close ties with the Tattinger estate, and was sent cases in appreciation.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Four steins of excellent Bavarian beer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/drink3.png><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>While Bond isn’t known as a beer-drinking man, he did make occasional exceptions. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</a>, Bond is getting married to the beautiful Tracy Di Vicenzo. At his bachelor party, he manages to down four steins of beer in quick succession (about 4 pints). Always one to mix his drinks, he also orders a double Steinhäger Schnapps to wash them down.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Six measures of vodka with one of Vermouth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/214214.png><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Even seasoned drinkers would find it hard to make it through the drink Bond girl Solitaire mixes for our hero in the novel Live and Let Die. A whopping six parts vodka to one of Vermouth made one of the strongest vodka martinis Bond ever downed. As she wisely said to the British super spy while handing him a glass, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">six to one sounds terribly strong</a>.”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>To be fair, Bond and Solitaire had just survived a near-death experience involving an underwater mine, so at least had a good reason to get wasted.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>One large glass of Vesper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/drink5.png><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the greatest Bond drink ever, the Vesper packs a refined yet heavy punch. As Bond explains to a bemused French barman in the book Casino Royale, he wants “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel</a>.”</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=219 data-injectable=false>Bond goes on to say that while he never has more than one drink before dinner, he does like it to be “large and very strong and very cold and very well-made.” He decides to name the drink after his female companion.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Anyone wanting to make the perfect Vesper these days may be out of luck. Kina Lillet isn’t even produced anymore. In the ‘50s, it was a very strong fortified wine with an extremely bitter taste. Lillet Blanc is the closest the modern drinker can come to it.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>The Vesper is possibly the most inebriating of all the Bond drinks, mixing wine, gin, and vodka in a dangerously intoxicating brew. Classy and cool, it is the ideal accompaniment to an all-night card session… if you can still see straight after downing one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6o7vNnapmn6KarrWx0q1knq6Vp3qlvsinomanopmys7%2BMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
