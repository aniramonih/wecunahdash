He was recruited by advertising agency Oglivy & Mather in Toronto, but requested the firm transfer him to their London offices when he was 27.</p><p id=er2YY2L-ot data-wc=37>David clearly knew what he was looking for, as he soon became the firm's youngest ever Director of Account Services. However, the young professional's life was about to change in a way he could never have predicted.</p><h2>Meeting Elton</h2><p id=eTzRt-1-fB data-wc=64>David met Elton John on October 30, 1993, when a mutual friend invited him to dinner at the singer's mansion. Discovering they had a lot in common the duo immediately hit it off and it wasn't long before their relationship became serious. In 1994, David resigned from his advertising position, after finding it difficult to balance work with the demands of his high-profile relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2>Filmmaking</h2><p id=ev39qVoOTw data-wc=57>Building on his already keen interest in films, David took several courses at the British Film Institute and went on to set up his own production company, Rocket Pictures, with Elton's support. His first project was the 1997 venture , an acclaimed 'warts and all' documentary about his superstar partner, which he directed.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezMRg4FRirE data-wc=80>David followed this with two fashion documentaries and a role as producer on a pair of feature films, which included hit 2006 British comedy flick . He also came up with the idea for the hugely successful , for which he was executive producer of live film. David's production company produced both and its sequel . He also worked alongside his husband on the 2019 Elton John biopic .</p><h2>Civil partnership and marriage</h2><p id=e4QSkBEqYBn data-wc=47>Despite being a partnership regularly featured in the pages of glossy magazines, when David entered into a civil partnership with Elton on December 21, 2005, it was an ultra-private ceremony with just their parents, photographer Sam Taylor-Wood, her husband Jay Jopling, and David's dog Arthur as witnesses.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKbBXaRRFy data-wc=63>The pair later converted their civil partnership into a marriage in Windsor in 2014, on the ninth anniversary of their civil partnership. Christmas time is a busy period for important days in the couple's calendar, as their first son Zachary was born via surrogate on 25 December 2010. The pair's second son Elijah was born 11 January 2013 via the same surrogate mother.</p><h2>Charity work and activism</h2><p id=eVVxvsFB-u data-wc=50>As well as spending time with his family and working on his films, David is also involved in charity work. He sits on the board of the Elton John AIDS Foundation in both the UK and the US and regularly auctions off designer items from his wardrobe for good causes.</p><p id=eoBPdETJBX data-wc=7>For more news about David, <a class=hm-link href=#>see here</a>.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9vcWhksaLCyJ1kn62io7a0tI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
