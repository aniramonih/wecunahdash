Platinum Weird released its debut album, "Make Believe," in 2006.</p><p>Among her other career endeavors, DioGuardi briefly starred on Broadway as Roxie Hart in the musical "Chicago" in late 2011.

The house includes marble and hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, a massive eat-in kitchen with a central island, stunning chandeliers, multiple fireplaces, and high ceilings.</p><p>In 2010 Kara paid $1.2 million for a waterfront home in Prospect Harbor, Maine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8qaqZpllJ68qMHAq5uiZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
