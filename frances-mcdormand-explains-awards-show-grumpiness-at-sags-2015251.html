Frances McDormand, who was unforgettably grim-faced at the Golden Globes earlier this month, won the 2015 SAG Award for Best Female Actress in a TV Movie or Miniseries and explained her sourpuss expression on Sunday, Jan. 25.
The cameras flashed to McDormand in her seat, again looking displeased as nominees were announced. When the Olive Kitteridge actress, 57, was announced as the winner, she quickly got up from her seat, walked a long journey past her fellow nominees, and scurried up on stage to deliver a rather eloquent speech."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Okay now," she told her peers, hyperventilating slightly and displaying emotion through her hand motions. "I love what I do. Thank you for inviting myself and Mr. Richard Jenkins to the party. We love what we do, we're proud of it, and we love Olive Kitteridge."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McDormand, wearing a black floor-length gown with sheer sleeves, then reflected about dressing up for awards shows — stilettos included. "I wish we could get some really cozy slippers, a box of See's Nuts & Chews. Hang out and watch more of our work, because every little snippet that I see, I want to watch more and more."</p><p>She went on: "This is a celebration, right? We're celebrating. It's a proclamation. I'm proclaiming if you haven’t seen Olive Kitteredge you need to. You can stream it, I don’t know how.
