His mother evacuated there from the Nashes’ home town of Salford, Lancashire, because of the Second World War.</p><p>In the early 1960s, he co-founded the Hollies, one of the UK’s most successful pop groups, with school friend Allan Clarke. Credited on the first album as “Group Leader”, he occasionally took the lead vocals. Nash was featured vocally on “Just One Look” in 1964 and sang his first lead vocal on the original Hollies song “To You My Love” on the band’s second album In The Hollies Style (1964).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He then progressed to often singing featured bridge vocals on Hollies recordings; “So Lonely”, “I’ve Been Wrong”, “Pay You Back With Interest”. Also by 1966 Nash was providing a few solo lead vocals on Hollies albums, and then from 1967 also on B-sides to singles, notably “On a Carousel” and “Carrie Anne”.</p><h2>Graham Nash Wife</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Nash was married to his first wife, Rose Eccles from 1964 until 1966. He was married to Susan Sennett for 38 years until 2016 when he divorced.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span> Graham Nash Photo<h2>Graham Nash Children</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He has three adult children.</p><h2>Graham Nash Photography</h2><p>While continually building his musical legacy, Nash is also an internationally renowned photographer and visual artist. With his photography, Nash has drawn honors including the New York Institute of Technology’s Arts & Technology Medal and Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters and the Hollywood Film Festival’s inaugural Hollywood Visionary Cyber Award.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His work is collected in the book Eye to Eye: Photographs by Graham Nash; he curated others’ work in the volume Taking Aim: Unforgettable Rock ‘n’ Roll Photographs Selected by Graham Nash (2009).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Nash’s work has been shown in galleries and museums worldwide. His company Nash Editions’ original IRIS 3047 digital printer and one of its first published works—Nash’s 1969 portrait of David Crosby— is now housed in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in recognition of his revolutionary accomplishments in the fine arts and digital printing world.</p><h2>Graham Nash Autobiography</h2><p>In September 2013, Nash released his long-awaited autobiography Wild Tales, which delivers an engrossing, no-holds-barred look back at his remarkable career and the music that defined a generation. The book landed him on the New York Times Best Sellers list and will be released in a paperback format this fall.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Graham Nash Digital Fine Art Printing</h2><p>In the late 1980s, Nash began to experiment with digital images of his photography on Macintosh computers with the assistance of R. Mac Holbert who at that time was the tour manager for Crosby, Stills, and Nash as well as handling computer/technical matters for the band.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Nash ran into the problem common with all personal computers running graphics software during that period: he could create very sophisticated detailed images on the computer, but there was no output device (computer printer) capable of reproducing what he saw on the computer screen.</p><p>Nash and Holbert initially experimented with early commercial printers that were then becoming available and printed many images on the large format Fujix inkjet printers at UCLA’s JetGraphix digital output center. When Fuji decided to stop supporting the printers, John Bilotta, who was running JetGraphix, recommended that Nash and Holbert look into the Iris printer, a new large-format continuous-tone inkjet printer built for prepress proofing by IRIS Graphics, Inc.</p><p>Through IRIS Graphics national sales rep Steve Boulter, Nash also met programmer David Coons, a color engineer for Disney, who was already using the IRIS printer there to print images from Disney’s new digital animation system.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Coons worked off hours at Disney to produce large images of 16 of Nash’s photographic portraits on Arches watercolor paper using Disney’s in-house model 3024 IRIS printer for a 24 April 1990 show at Simon Lowinsky gallery.</p><p>Since most of the original negatives and prints had been lost in shipment to a book publisher, Coons had to scan contact sheets and enhance the images so they could be printed in large format. He used software he had written to output the photographic images to the IRIS printer, a machine designed to work with proprietary prepress computer systems.</p><p>In July 1990 Graham Nash purchased an IRIS Graphics 3047 inkjet printer for $126,000 and set it up in a small carriage house in Manhattan Beach, California near Los Angeles. David Coons and Steve Boulter used it to print an even larger November 1990 show of Nash’s work for Parco Stores in Tokyo.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>The show entitled Sunlight on Silver was a series of 35 celebrity portraits by Nash which were 3 feet by 4 feet in an edition of 50 prints per image, a total of 1,750 images. Subsequently, Nash exhibited his photographs at the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego and elsewhere.</p><h2>Graham Nash Editions</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In 1991, Nash agreed to fund Mac Holbert to start a fine art digital-based printing company using the IRIS Graphics 3047 printer sitting in Nash’s Manhattan Beach, California carriage house. Holbert retired as road manager for Crosby, Stills, and Nash so that he could run the company.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>It opened its doors on 1 July 1991 with the name of Nash Editions Ltd. Early employees included David Coons, John Bilotta and a serigraphic printmaker named Jack Duganne. They worked to further adapt the IRIS printer to fine art printing, experimenting with ink sets to try to overcome the fast-fading nature of IRIS prints, and even going as far as sawing off part of the print heads so they could be moved back to clear thicker printing paper stocks (voiding the $126,000 machine’s warranty).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Nash and Holbert decided to call their fine art prints “digraphs” although Jack Duganne coined the name “Giclée” for these type of prints. The company is still in operation and currently uses Epson-based large format printers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 2005, Nash donated the original IRIS Graphics 3047 printer and Nash Editions ephemera to the National Museum of American History, a Smithsonian Institution.</p><h2>Graham Nash Albums</h2><ul><li>Songs for Beginners – 1971</li><li>Wild Tales – 1974</li><li>Earth & Sky – 1980</li><li>Innocent Eyes – 1986</li><li>Songs for Survivors – 2002</li><li>This Path Tonight – 2016</li></ul><h2>Graham Nash Songs</h2><ul><li>Long Cool Woman</li><li>Military Madness</li><li>He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother</li><li>I Used to Be a King</li><li>The Air That I Breathe</li><li>Wounded Bird</li><li>Prison Song</li><li>Simple Man</li><li>Carrie-Anne</li><li>Immigration Man</li><li>Myself At Last</li><li>Sleep Song</li><li>Another Sleep Song</li><li>Stop, Stop, Stop</li><li>Oh!
