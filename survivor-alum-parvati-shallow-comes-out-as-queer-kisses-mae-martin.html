The comic also shared a video of Shallow winking for the camera during a beach date, which Shallow reposted on her account.</p><p class=p3>Many of Shallow’s <a href=#>fellow <i>Survivor </i>alums</a> shared their best wishes for the new couple.</p><p class=p3>“So happy for you two! You look so happy! <span class=s1>🌈</span>,” <strong>Eliza Orlins</strong>, who competed on season 9, wrote via Instagram comment.</p><p class=p3>Season 29 winner <strong>Natalie Anderson</strong> added: “Get it girl!!!!!!! Here for you being queer! <span class=s1>💁🏽‍♀️</span>.”</p><p class=p3>Shallow, who will next appear on <a href=#><i>The Traitors </i>season 2</a>, previously teased her relationship with Martin last month.</p><p class=p3>“Some people come into your life at the perfect and most unexpected time. They see you, they love you right where you are, they make you laugh so hard you cry. They celebrate your wins and lift you up,” Shallow wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> in November, sharing pics with Martin, <strong>Suzanne Muchin</strong> and <strong>Ariel Stern</strong>. “They do art projects with your kids and play hide and seek after dinner. When you’re sequestered in an airport hotel alone on your birthday, they throw a big surprise party for you when you’re home. They remind you that even when it’s hard, life can be a really beautiful journey.”</p><p class=p3>Shallow was previously married to fellow <i>Survivor </i>alum<strong> John Fincher</strong>, whom she wed in July 2017. The pair, who share daughter Ama, split in August 2021. <i>Us Weekly </i>broke the news later that month that Shallow had<a href=#> filed for a temporary protective order</a> against Fincher, 40, for domestic violence protection. Shallow claimed that she “didn’t feel safe” around Fincher, who denied the accusations.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“Ms. Shallow’s false allegations of domestic violence were truly unfortunate,” Fincher’s attorney, Joy Dracup Stanley, told <i>Us Weekly</i> in a statement that September. “Temporary Domestic Violence Restraining Orders are easy to obtain and unfortunately are the most abused legal tactic to gain an advantage in custody — often done at the commencement of a divorce. Fortunately, they often backfire on the claimant. Mr. Fincher categorically denies all allegations and the dismissal speaks for itself. He has shared custody of their 3-year-old child.”</p><p class=p3><i>Us </i>confirmed in September 2021 that a judge<a href=#> dismissed Shallow’s TRO request</a>. Shallow and Fincher have since been granted joint legal and physical custody of their daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasraKrtre70WaYpa2dYr2ivtWaq6Jlo52urbjOsGScp52awG671K1kmqtdpsKmsdFmoqKro5rAbrnAnmSmmaKptq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
