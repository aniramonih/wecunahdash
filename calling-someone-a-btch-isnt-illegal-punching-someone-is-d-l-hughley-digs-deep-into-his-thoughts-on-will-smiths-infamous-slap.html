The comedian made a dig at Smith’s wife during his monologue and Smith, much to the shock of viewers and attendees alike, took enough issue with the comment to make his way to the podium and slap the confused smile right off of Rock’s face.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=723 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>While Rock himself was initially incredibly quiet about the controversy, his recent Netflix special, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Selective Outrage</a> was clearly his therapeutic way of coping with the slap heard ‘round the world. The “selective outrage” Rock is talking about is aimed exclusively at Smith, who — as he jokes throughout the special — is directing his frustrations at the wrong person. Rock thinks the aggression was truly meant for Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, who had recently admitted to a four-year “entanglement” – an affair Pinkett-Smith had with her son’s friend, then 22-year-old musician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">August Alsina</a>. Will Smith <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has since apologized for</a> his reaction, but it hasn’t done much to quell the conversation.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Rock isn’t the only person to blame Will Smith’s assault on his wife’s antics. Since the start of the brouhaha, fans and celebrities alike have been expressing support for one party or the other. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Cannon believes</a> that Smith’s response was a build-up of rage after being on the “Toxic” red table internet talk show Pinkett-Smith co-hosted. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Carrey was quick to shame</a> Smith for his disproportionate response, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Harvey thought it was</a> “a punk move.” Now comedic legend<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">D.L. Hughley</a></strong> is weighing in on the subject.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VladTV</a>, Hughley goes to bat, unapologetically defending Rock’s word choice from the event that night saying, “What do you call somebody that f**ks your son’s best friend, and then brings you on a show where you talk about it?”</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interviewer DJ Vlad</a> pushes the word choice, noting that the whole crowd went quiet as soon as Rock labeled Pinkett-Smith a b**ch.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>“If we take b**ch off the table, what is it? What do you say? There has to be some way to express your outrage about it, right?” Hughley pushed back, “If somebody did that to you, what would you call them?”</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>As a comedian, Hughley understands the risk inherent in an inelegant joke. Despite this — and arguments that, due to the joke, the slap was warranted — he can’t get behind arguments that Smith was in the right, “You think that a joke is more impactful than a slap. I disagree.”</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>He refuses to hold back throughout the interview, emphasizing that “[being called] a bitch is better than getting slapped,” and accurately noting that “Calling [somebody] a bitch isn’t illegal. Punching somebody is.”</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Hughley is just as convinced the attack was a reflection of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Table interview</a> as Chris Rock himself. He insinuates that the emotion Smith displaced on Rock was a symptom of a heartsickness deeply engrained in a man whose wife forced him to talk about deeply personal issues for social media acclaim.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>“You know, it’s insulting to me… Stop pretending that when Will cried that night and was so emotional that night, that wasn’t based on one joke. That wasn’t based on one joke about Jada, that was some whole other s**t going on.”</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>As Rock says in his special, “We’ve all been cheated on, but we’ve never had to go and do an interview with the person who cheated on us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SworjLoqWgZaOkuqa7zZ5kmmWSqbCpecispa1lmaG5prPApWSprZ6Ytaq6xmaqqKWVpLumecisZJ1lnGK1trPHpZyyZZSetLR5w56cqWWZo8GweceiqmasmKTCqLTTrGSopl2stq24jKykoqyYqHqqusWapKito2LAra3PaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
