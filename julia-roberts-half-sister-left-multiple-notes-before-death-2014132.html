Nancy Motes — the &#34;August: Osage County&#34; star's half-sister, who was found dead on Sunday — may have committed suicide.
Ed Winter, who is the assistant chief of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office, confirmed to Yahoo the existence of multiple &#34;notes found at the scene,&#34; though he added, &#34;We are not giving any other details at this time.&#34;
Motes, who is the 37-year-old younger half-sibling of Julia, Eric Roberts (father of Emma Roberts), and their sister Lisa Roberts Gillan, was found dead in a bathtub of a Los Angeles residence on Sunday afternoon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A statement issued on behalf of the family said that she died of "an apparent drug overdose" and Winter told Yahoo that there were "both prescription and nonprescription pills also found." However, the role the drugs may or may not have played is not yet known.</p><p>That's because while an autopsy was completed, "cause of death is deferred pending additional tests," said Winter. Specifically, they are awaiting the results from a toxicology report, which could take up to 10 weeks.</p><p>The New York Daily News reported that the <a href=#>suicide note was five pages</a> and included passages about the 46-year-old Oscar winner. As previously reported, their family life wasn't always picture perfect. Motes, who shares a mother with Julia and her siblings, gave a <a href=#>tell-all interview</a> to the same newspaper in August in which she detailed the rocky relationship she had with her famous sister.</p><p>And Motes reportedly posted <a href=#>negative comments about Julia on Twitter</a> in the days leading up to her death. However, they were later deleted from the account. It remains unclear who removed them from the social media site.</p><p>Despite her apparent turmoil with her sister, Motes, who was supposed to get married this year, worked as a production assistant on Fox's "Glee," a job that Julia reportedly helped her get. She also had a part-time gig as a pet-sitter and was reportedly at a client's home when she took her life.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Julia has yet to comment directly about her sister's death beyond the statement attributed to the family. The mom of three pulled out of the annual Academy Awards luncheon on Monday and hasn't been seen publicly.</p><p>Meanwhile, her brother Eric, who is known for his Oscar-nominated role in "Runaway Train," has replied to a few people who offered him sympathy on Twitter.</p><p>Emma, who most recently appeared on "American Horror Story: Coven," has not commented on social media at all. The day news broke that Motes died — Monday — was her 23rd birthday. She was seen looking glum that day as she had lunch with her fiancé, Evan Peters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWerO7wZ6pratdna6tsoysoKyslad6rbHFrWSmrZyptrG4xGalqKyVqHqjscWoqZ5llJqutbSMa2dqbGFofw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
