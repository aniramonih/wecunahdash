However, most Japanese players agree on the fact that the most important ultimately is having good damage dealers with skills targetting all enemies. Here are the characters on top of the tier list when it comes to rerolling.</p><p>5-star Rimuru Tempest “Harmonizer of Majin and Humans” who’s one of the best healers and damage dealers, with an ultimate targetting all enemies. He can also decrease a single target’s Secret Skill Gauge by 5%.</p><p>5-star Rimuru Tempest “Chancellor of Tempest”, which is pretty much the best ATK buffer in the game. He can also buff DEF.</p><p>5-star Milim Nava “Dragon Majin”, She has one of the best ATK buff in the game, boosting your Ultimate.</p><p>5-star Milim Nava “One of the Oldest Demon Lords” she’s one of the best buffers and DMG dealers.</p><p>Basically, if you get any of these four 5-star characters, it’s fine to keep that reroll account as your main. Those are the characters you should aim for when rerolling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pcHApaqhp5OgsrO%2FjZympmejobausYyiqp6jkZ56rrHMqKminaNiwaqx0WajoqukYsSptcKhZJygkaeupMDEq6pmrJ9iv6a%2BzqWjZp6fp3qowcidnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
