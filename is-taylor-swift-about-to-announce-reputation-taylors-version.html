After Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) both dropped In 2021, Swift released Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July, while<a href=#> 1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a> hit shelves in October.</p><p>With just two rerecords left to announce — 2016’s Reputation and her 2006 self-titled debut — fans have begun to look for hints as to which record is next on the list. All signs began to point toward Reputation when multiple singles <a href=#>were featured</a> on various TV shows earlier this summer, like “Delicate (Taylor’s Version)” and “Look What You Made Me Do,” which appeared on Prime Video’s The Summer I Turned Pretty and Wilderness, respectively.</p><p>Swift has also seemingly been <a href=#>transitioning her wardrobe</a> to incorporate more “Rep era” tones like black, silver and gold, a signature move she often turns to when wanting to hint at upcoming projects.</p><p>“Easter eggs can be left on clothing or jewelry,” Swift explained in a 2019 interview with<a href=# rel=noopener> Entertainment Weekly</a>. “This is one of my favorite ways to do this because you wear something that foreshadows something else.” And people don’t always find this one out immediately, but they know you’re probably sending a message.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for every hint Swift is about to announce Reputation (Taylor’s Version):</p><h3>Every Song But ‘I Did Something Bad’</h3><p>Since kicking off the Eras Tour earlier this year, Swift has performed every song off Reputation during the “surprise songs” section of the concert with the exception of one: “I Did Something Bad.”</p><p>Fans believe holding off on the track may be intentional, as it could be a wink and a nod to Rep’s designated “era,” much like she previously held off on performing “New Romantics,” until she announced 1989 (Taylor’s Version).</p><h3>Silver, Black and Gold All Over</h3><p>Prior to her Speak Now (TV) and 1989 (TV) release, Swift subtly changed the color of her Eras Tour outfits to hint at an upcoming album announcement.</p><p>During her November 24 concert in São Paulo, Brazil, the singer rocked a silver jacket for her performance of “The Man” and a silver dress during her Fearless era. Later in the show, her Speak Now gown was a pink design that featured black and gold embellishments throughout. (Black, gold and silver are Reputation’s signature colors.)</p><h3>Dancers Drop Clues</h3><p>One of Swift’s dancers on the Eras Tour, <strong>Jan Ravnik</strong>, took to social media in November to post a black and white photo of a snake via his Instagram Stories. The reptile served as the symbol for Swift’s Reputation era in 2016, referencing her feud with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> in which the reality star called Swift a snake.</p><h3 class=p1><b>Wink, Wink</b></h3><p class=p1>After the<i> Speak Now</i> section during Swift’s first São Paulo concert, eagle-eyed Swifties noticed that when she walked off the stage, she turned her head around and winked. Fans on <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s1>social media</span></a> theorized that the gesture might indicate that Swift could have a surprise up her sleeves during the remaining Brazil tour dates.</p><h3 class=p1><strong>Tick Tock on the Clock</strong></h3><p class=p1>Swift was named TIME’s <a href=#>2023 Person of the Year</a> on December 6. As part of the announcement, artist <strong>Jane Perkins</strong> created a <a href=# rel=noopener>mosaic portrait</a> of the singer packed with more than 30 Easter eggs. On the picture’s right side, fans noticed a toy snake placed next to a clock with the hands pointed at 12 and 7. The snake and clock also sit next to a friendship bracelet that says “Taylor’s Version,” leading many to believe Swift will release Reputation (Taylor’s Version) on December 7.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Supporting this theory is the fact that Swift’s “Rep Memories” <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram Story highlights</a> began on December 7, 2017. The first post from the series is a behind-the-scenes video of Swift and <strong>Jack Antonoff</strong> writing the track “Getaway Car.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Every-Hint-Taylor-Swift-Is-About-to-Announce-Reputation-Taylors-Version.jpg><h3><b>The Devil’s in the (Stylish) Details</b></h3><p class=p1>Swift <a href=#><span class=s1>stepped out for dinner</span></a> with pal <b>Blake Lively </b>in January 2024, wearing a green, velvet dress and snakeskin boots. Since snakes have become the signature iconography of <i>Reputation</i>, fans theorized that she was swapping her style to match the era.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqirs6uq2asn2Kur7rOrqWcnV2nsrHB05qroqeeYsGixcuoqaxlppq%2FtLXOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
