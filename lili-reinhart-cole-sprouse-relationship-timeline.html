A month later, he tagged her&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in a second post</a>. In what became their M.O., the caption was a poetic mystery, giving fans all the material they needed for speculation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He wrote, "That crow is clicking at us, can you hear it? The wind is so strong, the bird is practically hovering. They say time moves faster for corvids. Years and decades are seconds and minutes to the black bird. That's why they click, to see if they can match our clocks. It's true! Shame it should be hovering, it must be so confused. Motionless and untethered by time. Don't worry for the crow, in mere moments it'll all pass.

"You have to have spaces for reverence in the industry. The more you let people in on that, the more people feel entitled to it and the more it becomes problematic with whoever you end up being with in the future, so I take that very seriously.
