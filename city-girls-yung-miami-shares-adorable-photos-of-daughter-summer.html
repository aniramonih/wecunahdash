The rapper was at first reluctant to go public with the news of her family’s growth for fear of what her pregnancy would mean for her budding career. Yung Miami, however, ultimately determined that her journey to motherhood was nothing short of a gift and, thus, decided to come out with the announcement regardless of the consequences.</p><p>The rapper was pleasantly surprised to learn that the public was welcoming of her pregnancy. “I received a lot of love,” Yung Miami <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> of the public’s response to her expectancy during a recent interview. “Everyone was very supportive of me,” she added. “I feel honored and blessed.”</p><p>Summer is Yung Miami’s second child.
