In July 2023, Meta introduced <a href=#>Threads</a>, a new app that connects to your Instagram account and allows you to share short snippets of text with your followers. Quickly, it became a competitor to <a href=#>Elon Musk's Twitter</a>.</p><p>But it seems that Mark may have some more news to share — news that Facebook users probably won’t be too fond of.</p><p>In 2023, there have been rumors floating around on social media <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that Facebook wants to start charging users a monthly rate of $4.99 to continue using the platform</a>.
