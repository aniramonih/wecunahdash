Skitz Kraven Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Hello everybody my name's Evan D kraven
I am today's newest patient
I'm glad I'm participatingI guess I'll start this off by saying
I'm a labelled assailant
They found a couple unknown bodies
Rotting under my basement But I'm not here to make new friends
I'm not the one you wanna blabble to
A paranoid-schizophrenic-fuck you-bitch
Attitude i'll slice you up with gratitude"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He introduces himself as a patient and tells the listener that he's not there to make new friends. He then informs them that he's been labeled an assailant and has bodies rotting under his basement. As he continues to rap, he talks about his hatred for his medication and how he instead spends time with his deceased love interest, Beth. The lyrics also include references to him killing his professor, cooking on the stove, and playing with organs. Overall, the lyrics paint the picture of a deranged individual who is detached from reality and takes pleasure in inflicting harm on others.</p><br><p>One interesting fact about Skitz Kraven's "That" is that the song was released in 2014 and has since become a popular track among horrorcore rap fans. Another fascinating aspect of the song is the various references to pop culture with mentions of famous horror film characters like Jason from Friday the 13th. The lyrics, although gruesome, are well-crafted and garner attention for their sheer shock value. It's also been said that the song was inspired by an actual case of a mentally disturbed individual who was found with human bodies in their house. Additionally, Skitz Kraven has stated that his music is meant to be a form of entertainment and shouldn't be taken too seriously.</p><br><p>As for the chords to the song, they are not available as "That" is an acapella rap track.</p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning"
