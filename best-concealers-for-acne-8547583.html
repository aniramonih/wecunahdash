Concealer is a great tool for camouflaging unwanted spots, but not all formulas are created equal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What you use under your eyes or as a brightener may not be the right shade or texture for covering up acne marks. In fact, an illuminating concealer may even draw more attention to a fiery red blemish. Fortunately, there are concealers that are designed with acne in mind that offer good coverage without caking, flaking, or making your breakouts worse.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-it-cosmetics-bye-bye-dark-spots-concealer--serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Dark Spots Concealer + Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Dark Spots Concealer + Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j4IWKbBHFXJTi-AOBGpHXTT3NsA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/it-cosmetics-bye-bye-dark-spots-concealer---serum-9f743829bc864ee88e4ddbe67d5bd650.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This multitasker treats common acne concerns while also covering them up.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The natural finish may be a little too radiant for those with very oily skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part makeup, part skincare, this multitasking formula is great for concealing both active acne and acne scars thanks to its buildable medium coverage and cocktail of skin-soothing and smoothing active ingredients. Anti-inflammatory niacinamide helps to calm redness, while hydrating hyaluronic acid targets the dryness and flakiness that often accompany pimples. If you are experiencing residual acne scarring or discoloration, those same ingredients brighten and plump the skin to improve tone and texture.</p><p>The dual-sided applicator allows for hands-free application at home or on the go. Tap a bit of the formula directly onto problem spots with the doe-foot applicator and then flip over to the kabuki brush for easy blending.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid<strong> | Coverage Level</strong>: Medium<strong> | Finish</strong>: Natural <strong>| Active Ingredients</strong>: Niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, caffeine<strong> | Shades</strong>: 18<strong> | Size</strong>: 0.22 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-cosmetics-16hr-camo-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

Available in 25 shades across three undertones (cool, neutral, warm), the creamy formula dries down to a velvety matte finish and stays in place for up to 16 hours of crease-free wear. Kaolin clay helps control excess oil and shine, making it a great choice for combination and oily skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just be careful when you are shade matching.

He likes the stick format for normal to oily skin types and says the formula – which includes zingiber aromaticus extract to brighten dark spots and chestnut rosa fruit extract to prevent oxidation – is great for camouflaging active breakouts and post-acne marks alike. “The SPF in it is also great protection especially if you've been using any acne treatments, which can make the skin more sun sensitive,” he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The long-wear concealer has a smooth texture that blends seamlessly into the skin. “For covering acne, you want something thicker and drier that provides more coverage and will stay in place," explains celebrity makeup artist Olivia Barad. "Clé de Peau's concealer is one of my go-tos because it hides dryness better than other cream formulas, and it really sticks to the blemish for a full-coverage finish that doesn't need to be layered over and over again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br><strong>Type</strong>: Cream<strong> | Coverage Level</strong>: Full | <strong>Finish</strong>: Matte <strong>| Active Ingredients</strong>: Hyaluronic acid, chestnut rosa fruit extract<strong> | Shades</strong>: 12<strong> | Size</strong>: 0.17 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-scars-kevyn-aucoin-the-sensual-skin-enhancer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne Scars</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kevyn Aucoin The Sensual Skin Enhancer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kevyn Aucoin The Sensual Skin Enhancer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7dunQzwUaN6b1pcE2e4BgTj_uII=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kevyn-aucoin-the-sensual-skin-enhancer--d0c1c006b9114fb982d03f312d970ca1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This 5-in-1 can be a concealer, color corrector, contourer, foundation, or highlighter.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The pot packaging makes application a bit trickier than the others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might hear this highly pigmented cream described as spackle-like, and that is true in so far as its ability to cover and smooth just about any current or former imperfection. But that description fails to capture how lightweight and natural it looks on the skin, which is why it is ideal for masking the tone and texture concerns associated with acne scars.</p><p>To use, dot a very tiny amount of the enhancer on your area of concern and blend it with your fingers or go-to application tool. Jojoba oil, vitamin E, and honey work to smooth, soothe, and brighten the complexion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream<strong> | Coverage Level</strong>: Full coverage<strong> | Finish</strong>: Natural<strong> | Active Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba oil, vitamin E, honey<strong> | Shades</strong>: 16<strong> | Size</strong>: 0.3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-acne-prone-skin-nars-soft-matte-complete-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NARS Soft Matte Concealer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NARS Soft Matte Complete Concealer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XV5GnVIJBb-jlCVfQkwVwWqoS-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NARS-Soft-Matte-Complete-Concealer-f07f4365ea384fff95c28279dfb738d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: The oil-free formula has a blurring, soft focus filter-like effect.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The matte finish may result in creasing on drier skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It sure feels like this pigmented pot was designed with oily skin in mind. The oil-free formula offers buildable full coverage that stays in place all day and a soft matte finish that keeps shine at bay without drawing attention to acne bumps or scars. Hydrating hyaluronic acid and an antioxidant-rich blend of vitamins A, C, and E work to soften and smooth skin over time, while an advanced powder technology helps to absorb and diffuse light to create a soft-focus effect that blurs the look of imperfections.</p><p><strong>Type</strong>: Cream<strong> | Coverage Level</strong>: Full coverage<strong> | Finish</strong>: Matte <strong>| Active Ingredients</strong>: Peptides, hyaluronic acid, vitamins A, C, E<strong> | Shades</strong>: 30<strong> |</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 0.21 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-full-coverage-mac-studio-finish-spf-35-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Full Coverage</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MAC Studio Finish Concealer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MAC Studio Finish SPF 35 Concealer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xAhkY0iOtLCkeZBtiY5BJjDMgW4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mac-studio-finish-spf-35-concealer-93fff8700b3d418fb4ab88212c661851.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: The opaque coverage somehow manages to blend imperceptibly into the skin.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It can be a little slippery on very oily skin, so be sure to set with powder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s all about the coverage with this ultra-pigmented pot that is ideal for covering pimples, redness, and acne scars. The highly concentrated concealer has a lightweight creamy texture (be advised that it sometimes takes a few seconds to warm up on the skin) that dries down into a natural opaque finish. The water-resistant formula stands up well to sweat, and SPF 35 means you are protecting your skin from the sun sensitization caused by many acne treatments and the dark spots that can come later.</p><p>Apply a small amount (trust us, a little goes a long way) directly to the spots or areas you want to cover and blend with a sponge or your fingers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Cream <strong>| Coverage Level</strong>: Full coverage<strong> | Finish</strong>: Natural <strong>| Active Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba seed oil, beeswax<strong> | Shades</strong>: 22 <strong>| Size</strong>: 0.64 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-tarte-shape-tape-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Shape Tape Concealer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Shape Tape Concealer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/P8fQ8KZt1-LoxhJTx0r64oRnMZs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarte-shape-tape-full-coverage-concealer--63098a463b63498b9d038d171a2df64c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This waterproof and crease-proof concealer also comes in an ultra-portable travel size.<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The formula can feel a little heavy for those with drier skin types.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You likely know someone who swears by this cult-favorite concealer, and Scibelli considers it a great option for sensitive skin types because of the clean, gentle formula that features mango and shea butters for conditioning and licorice root for brightening and color correcting. When it comes to covering up acne and post-acne marks, the full coverage matte formula looks natural because of the way it blends into the complexion. “The formula uses crease-proof technology so it will be flexible on the skin, while also being sweat and waterproof,” Scibelli says.</p><p><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid<strong> | Coverage Level</strong>: Full Coverage<strong> | Finish</strong>: Matte<strong> | Active Ingredients</strong>: Shea butter, mango butter, licorice root<strong> | Shades</strong>: 35<strong> | Size</strong>: 0.33 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-wear-fenty-beauty-pro-filtr-instant-retouch-concealer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Wear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Concealer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Longwear Liquid Concealer " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ow36gVZfSzK-YI0i6YjiR8lml2s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-by-rihanna-pro-filtr-instant-retouch-longwear-liquid-concealer-17d781bccda141c9918c5397c284eb45.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: There are 50 shades ranging from very fair to very deep — need we say more?<br><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> This formula dries down fast, so be prepared to blend quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rihanna’s complexion products get a lot of love for their seemingly infinite shade range (which we love!), but there is a lot more to say about this cover up. With buildable medium to full coverage and a soft matte finish, the creamy concealer camouflages blemishes, redness, and acne scars without feeling heavy.

Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid that gently exfoliates by going deep into the pores to remove the dead skin cells and sebum that can cause acne. “This concealer provides natural-looking coverage while also using salicylic acid to help reduce breakouts and blemishes,” Dr. Garshick says.</p><p>The pen-like applicator can take some getting used to, but it works well for spot treating and reapplication.

It refers to products and formulas that contain ingredients that won't clog or block the pores. “Clogged pores are one of the main contributors to acne,” says Dr. Marcus. “A non-comedogenic formula will at least ensure that the product does not make acne worse.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This extends to all areas of your beauty and skincare routine. “Any time you’re dealing with breakouts it is always important to look for products that are non-comedogenic and this includes makeup,” says Dr. Garshick.</p><p>With that said, there are ingredients, like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and sulfur, that have been proven to treat acne and keep pores clear. Some appear in complexion products that are designed for acne-prone skin. “Concealers that have an active acne-fighting ingredient can be helpful in treating acne,” says Dr. Marcus. “Adding an acne fighting ingredient to concealer can help to simultaneously conceal and treat an acne lesion.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shade<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may have a concealer that you use under your eyes or to contour, but that is not necessarily the same formula you want to use to cover up your breakouts. One reason is the shade. The idea is to make the spot blend into your skin as much as possible. “To cover up blemishes, you want a shade that closely matches your skin tone,” says Puckey, adding that it's likely different from the one you're using to brighten dark under-eye circles. “The shade you use under your eyes is usually a shade or two lighter than your foundation, but a concealer to cover your acne should match your foundation shade."</p><p>Both Puckey and Scibelli say the best way to find your perfect shade is by testing the concealers you are considering along the jawline and/or on the side of the face. If you plan to use the concealer with foundation, apply them together to see how well they match. If you will be using the concealer on bare skin, test it on a clean face. Either way, make sure that you try them out in both natural and artificial light to ensure a true match.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Texture<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you have active acne lesions or are dealing with post-acne marks, the goal of applying concealer is to cover up any discoloration and create the illusion of smoother skin. Puckey says formulas that are buildable, blendable, and highly pigmented are most suitable for acne coverage. From there, Scibelli likes to choose a formula based on skin type.</p><p>- <strong>For Acne-Prone Skin</strong>: “I like to consider clean and even oil-free formulas if you can,” says Scibelli. Additionally, he likes fragrance-free options as they are generally less irritating. If you want to be proactive, try an SPF-infused concealer. The sun protection will help prevent future discoloration.<br>- <strong>For Oily Skin:</strong> Scibelli recommends shopping for concealers with a matte finish to cut shine if you have skin on the combination or oily side. An added benefit? “It creates more of a flat appearance to your breakout,” he notes.<br>- <strong>For Redness: </strong>“If you're dealing with red breakouts or even red post-acne marks, I always like to color correct those areas first with a green concealer,” says Scibelli. The color correcting hue will neutralize the redness before you apply your regular concealer shade on top.</p><p>The best way to keep your concealer in place is to set it with a powder. “To increase the longevity of your concealer and prevent it from sliding or creasing, set it with a thin layer of translucent powder using a fluffy brush,” says Puckey.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it good to put concealer on acne?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether or not you want to cover up your acne marks is entirely up to you. But if you would like to camouflage pimples or acne scars with concealer, it is safe to do so. “It is okay to apply concealer to acne lesions to help provide coverage to the skin,” says Dr. Garshick. Depending on your skin type (think: dry, oily, acne-prone) and the type of acne (i.e. comedonal, papules, pustules, nodulocystic), certain makeup and skincare products may cause additional inflammation or irritation. For that reason, Dr. Marcus recommends looking for non-comedogenic formulas.</p><p>Concealer is a quick fix that can help even out your skin tone in the short term, but even formulas with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid won’t stop breakouts. Visiting a board certified dermatologist for a skin evaluation can help you determine the root cause of your acne and the best way to treat it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is liquid or stick concealer better for acne?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The concealer aisle does not lack options. One of the biggest choices you’ll make when buying a concealer for acne is the format. Do you want a liquid or a stick formula? Our experts agree that both have their benefits, and it really depends on your needs.</p><p>If you are using acne treatments as part of your skincare routine, liquid concealers might help offset some of the side effects. “Sometimes when we're treating our acne with ingredients that can be drying, a liquid formula will actually help to smooth out the texture of the area while covering and also prevent any flaking or drying,” Scibelli says.</p><p>For normal to oily skin types, Scibelli likes stick formulas because they tend to be buildable. Puckey adds that: “Stick concealers have a thicker consistency and provide higher coverage, making them ideal for camouflaging acne. They also tend to be more long-lasting, ensuring that your coverage stays in place throughout the day.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you cover up acne with concealer?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you are dealing with a breakout, your first thought might be to glob on as much foundation and concealer as you can find. But this does not yield the most natural-looking result and can lead to caking and sliding. To prevent this, our expert makeup artists say it’s important to first prep the skin. “Apply a primer that helps create a smooth canvas for application and prevents dryness or flakiness,” says Puckey.</p><p>If redness is a concern, Scibelli suggests using a green concealer or color corrector before moving on to concealer. “Whether you use a color corrector or not, I would use a liquid formula if your acne area is still on the normal to dry side,” he says. “If your skin is on the oily side, feel free to use a stick form of concealer.”</p><p>Once it’s time for the concealer, use a small synthetic brush or your fingers to apply the formula directly on the acne spots. “Gently blend the edges of the concealer using a tapping or patting motion, ensuring it seamlessly integrates with the surrounding skin,” says Puckey. This is important to ensure maximum coverage. “Sometimes when we use a sweeping motion with concealer or even foundation, it makes the formula more transparent,” cautions Scibelli. “So tapping or patting it in will keep its pigment.”</p><p>Need more coverage? Grab more product and repeat the tapping. “If necessary, apply an additional layer of concealer to areas that need more coverage,” says Puckey. “Make sure to blend each layer well to avoid a cakey appearance.” And don’t be afraid to get a little messy. “You can always use the top of your hand as a palette to pick up the desired amount of concealer and then continue to build up to it,” says Scibelli.</p><p>Last but not least, Puckey recommends setting the concealer by applying a translucent powder with a fluffy brush. He says this will “increase the longevity of your concealer and prevent it from sliding or creasing."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meg Storm</a> is a freelance writer and editor with nearly a decade of experience covering the beauty industry.
