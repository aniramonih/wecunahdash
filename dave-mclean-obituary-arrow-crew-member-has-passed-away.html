Death Cause –&nbsp;</strong>I’m here with a heavy heart to share the news of a great loss within the Arrow Crew family. On October 9th, we bid farewell to our dear friend and esteemed crew member, Dave McLean. Dave’s presence was felt from the very beginning of Arrow, and his impact on the crew and the entire production team was immeasurable.&nbsp;Dave wasn’t just a colleague; he was a character in the truest sense. Those who had the privilege of working alongside him know that he brought a unique energy to the set. His infectious laughter and unwavering positivity were constants, making even the most challenging days on set a little brighter.</p><p>The harsh reality of Dave’s passing is not just about the void he leaves in our daily work lives but about the rich legacy he leaves behind. Beyond the film sets and production meetings, Dave was a friend, a confidant, and a source of inspiration for many. His ability to bring joy to others, even in the face of adversity, was a testament to his remarkable character.&nbsp;One of the most remarkable aspects of Dave was his passion for his craft. As a dedicated member of the Arrow Crew, he consistently gave his best to ensure that each scene was captured with precision and creativity. His commitment to the art of filmmaking was evident in the quality of his work, and his expertise contributed significantly to the success of Arrow.</p><p>However, it’s the personal moments that we will treasure the most. The impromptu jokes between takes, the shared meals during long shoots, and the camaraderie that extended beyond the confines of the set – these are the memories that will linger in our hearts. Dave had an uncanny ability to foster a sense of unity among the crew, turning colleagues into friends and creating a familial atmosphere on and off set.&nbsp;As we come to terms with the loss of our dear friend, it’s essential to remember the positive impact Dave had on each of us individually and on the Arrow Crew as a whole. His legacy lives on not only through the films and television series he helped create but also in the bonds of friendship and camaraderie that he cultivated among us.</p><p>In times like these, we lean on each other for support, remembering the laughter and shared experiences that defined our time with Dave. Let’s honor his memory by continuing to foster the spirit of collaboration and joy that he so effortlessly brought into our lives.&nbsp;Dave McLean may no longer be with us physically, but his laughter, his warmth, and his indomitable spirit will forever echo on the sets of Arrow and in the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJyRq7JuucKlnJqmXaSvqsDUmqmyZZGnv7DDjJypnq9dorKursSrZKGZo2K9or%2FSnptmmaeWxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
