Following a gang of obscenely wealthy Asians and Asian Americans residing in Los Angeles, California, Bling Empire made its premiere in 2021. The third season of the L.A.-based show debuted in 2022, and now Netflix is introducing its New York City-based sister show.</p><p>The series, according to Netflix, is a brand-new group of affluent, cultured, and amusing Asian Americans from New York City, where the value of a home is determined by its address rather than its size. Discussions are straightforward and uncoded. And there is a ferocious struggle for love, wealth, and power. In a city where you can be anyone you want to be, they go on to say that the cast is made up of billionaires, CEOs, and fashion icons.</p><p>The cast of the television program Bling Empire includes <strong>Lynn Ban</strong>. Jewelry created by Lynna has been seen by celebrities like <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, <strong>Nicki Minaj</strong>, and <strong>Rihanna</strong>. Her husband, <strong>Jett Kain</strong>, is a star in the recently released Netflix spin-off series Bling Empire: New York in 2023. And viewers wonder if he is gay and question his sexuality.</p><p>Check Out: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tina Leung</strong></a>.</p><h2>Lynn Ban’s Husband Jett Kain From Netflix’s Bling Empire Is Not Gay, as He Is Married to His Wife for Years!</h2><p><strong>Jett Kain</strong>, husband of <strong>Lynn Ban</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lynn ban</a>) from Netflix's Bling Empire Newyork, is not gay. Despite what some viewers think, Jett is straight because he has been married to his wife Lynn for a long time and they are still together. Invading <strong>Blake</strong>'s personal space and asking Blake intrusive questions about his sexuality in the third reality show episode left viewers of the show with the impression that Jett was a secret gay.</p><p>Jett Kain has <a href=# rel=noopener>experience</a> as a producer and reporter for MTV. It may come as a surprise to anyone who has visited Lynn Ban's Instagram feed to learn that her husband Jett is the photographer for all of her images. As per the show Bling Empire New York, Jett and Lynn frequently separate due to their busy work schedules. Jett remarked on Bling Empire saying;</p><p><strong>There's nothing like being in New York to spend time with my wife</strong></p><p>The majority of viewers believed that Lynn Ban's husband and business partner Jett Kain was unquestionably gay after seeing the third episode of Bling Empire: New York. It was during that episode that the couple and Blake went on a lunch date in a metropolitan restaurant with tables outside. Kain's interactions with the homosexual Blake cemented, in the eyes of many.</p><p>However, he has also been in love with Lynn for a year. So questioning his sexuality and wondering if he is gay doesn't make sense. College student Lynn met mainstream MTV reporter/producer Jett for the first time at a New Year's Eve party in 1994, and the two fell in love right away. He still remembers how, when he first approached her to ask for her number, blissfully unaware that she would give him the wrong one.</p><p>As a result, their success in this area eventually inspired them to experiment with other areas, which led to the early 2010 <a href=# rel=noopener>introduction</a> of Lynn Ban Jewelry. While Lynn has always focused on the creative side of her brand, her husband has essentially managed everything behind the scenes to ensure exposure, notably press and marketing. She has made it plain that she sees her partner in every meaning of the word, her best friend, and her soulmate in the father of her child they received a son named Sebastian in the late 2000s.</p><p>Even though they have experienced their fair share of difficulties especially given how direct they both are they have remained completely committed to one another throughout. Of course, the couple is still happily married and looking forward to many more years together based on what we can tell from Lynn's social media profiles as of writing (Jett is not on any such site).</p><p>In the show, people laughed at the fact that Jett used a sarcastic tone and made stereotypically gay gestures, yet went on to make Blake uncomfortable and question him about his sexual orientation. If Lynn Ban doesn't want people to speculate about her husband's sexuality, she could merely forbid her spouse from asking questions. She made a mistake by bringing Jett Kain onto Bling Empire. She is despised by many fans only because of her 'husband's gay accusation. So whatever has happened in the show, concluding Lynn Ban's husband Jett Kain is not gay and doesn't seem to be engaged with any male.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGigrGWamsG1ecqaoKdll5bGbq7LoqWgZZWivaq%2BxGajsqaeYq%2BiuoyhrKyakaOxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
