His YouTube channel has since grown beyond his wildest dreams, garnering millions of well-entertained subscribers who tune in to listen to his distinct accent, energetic commentary, and use of colorful swear words. As of January 2022, he had amassed over 27.8 million subscribers and over 14.8 billion views.</p><p>As he continues to produce and post more entertaining videos, Sean’s video viewership and overall popularity will continue to soar high. However, with the popularity he has already, he has been able to diversify his earnings into non-internet-related ventures. Jacksepticeye certainly has a lot to brag about but he doesn’t let all of that get into his head. He remains grounded and even does his fair share of charity work.</p><p><strong>Here are Some Interesting Facts:</strong></p><ul><li>Full Name: Seán William McLoughlin, better known as Jacksepticeye</li><li>Net Worth: $35 million</li><li>Birthday: February 7, 1990</li><li>Place of birth: Cloghan, County Offaly, Ireland</li><li>Occupation: YouTuber</li><li>YouTube Channel: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jacksepticeye</a> (the most subscribed Irish channel in the world)</li><li>Current residence: Brighton, East Sussex, England</li><li>Girlfriend: Jacksepticeye has been dating Dutch YouTuber Evelien “Gab” Smolders since 2019</li><li>Associated Acts: PewDiePie, Markiplier, Game Grumps</li></ul><h2><strong>Jacksepticeye’s Fortune Primarily Came From His YouTube Career</strong></h2><p>Jacksepticeye created his YouTube account on February 24, 2007, but didn’t start posting videos on it. It took him about five years before he was able to get around to putting his YouTube channel to good use. The young man had tried his hands at music, serving as a drummer for the metalcore band Raised to the Ground. In 2009, the band released an extended play titled Risen From The Ashes. While it’s not clear what exactly led to him quitting music, he soon later began concentrating on content creation on YouTube and found success doing so. He waited until November 12, 2012, after graduating from the university before he began posting videos on the platform.</p><p>The very first video the YouTuber uploaded to his channel was one of a solid snake impression. As earlier mentioned, Jacksepticeye first did voice impressions before switching to making gameplay content. His early videos attracted some attention as he had about 2,200 subscribers on his channel. After switching to making Let’s Play videos in 2013, he caught his big break as famous YouTuber PewDiePie gave him a shout-out. PewDiePie had done a competition for upcoming YouTubers and Jacksepticeye was one of the entrants who made the top 10. This prompted a shout-out that instantaneously led to the growth of Jack’s subscribers. In the space of four days, his number of subscribers rose from 2,500 to 15,000.</p><p>On his YouTube channel, Sean uploads videos of him playing games like Dark Souls, Far Cry 3, The Sims 4, Undertale, Subnautica, The Escapists, etc. These videos have helped him enjoy steady growth as he today has over 27 million subscribers on his channel. He has collaborated with various YouTubers and featured traditional celebrities like Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Tom Holland, Brad Pitt, Chris Hemsworth, and Margot Robbie. All of these collaborations and the attention brought by the celebrities he has featured on his channel have led to his content being viewed close to 15 billion times. This translates to how he has been able to make so much money.</p><h4><strong>How Much He Makes on YouTube&nbsp;</strong></h4><span class=su-highlight>&nbsp;<strong>According to YouTube’s monetization policy, creators on the platform make anywhere from $2-$7 per 1000 views. This means that Jacksepticeye may have made as much as 100 million from his time on YouTube.</strong>&nbsp;</span><h4><strong>Earnings From Twitch Subscriptions</strong></h4><p>Twitch offers three subscription levels; $4.99, $9.99 and $24.99. Popular streamers such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jacksepticeye</a> make approximately 50% of the subscription fee. For someone like Jacksepticeye with a large loyal fan base of over 7,000 subs, It is estimated that he could be making a very comfortable living on subscriptions alone.</p><p>As of early 2021, he has over 6,500 subs in tier 1 ($4.99). At a 50% subscription fee, this could easily mean him over $16,250 a month</p><h3><strong>He Also Posts Vlogs About His Life</strong></h3><p>In addition to him posting Let’s Play videos, Jacksepticeye also posts random videos that give his fans and subscribers an insight into his life. Through these videos, the world has gotten to learn about his family, particularly his married younger sister Allison and brother Malcolm who reportedly lived in France.</p><p>In one of these videos, the YouTuber revealed how his name came about. He was first nicknamed Jack by his mother as this was a common name for people named either Sean or John in Ireland and UK. His siblings amplified the usage of this name to address him and it was soon used by all his schoolmates. While in school, he got a severe injury on one of his eyes which later got infected soon after. The infection led to the eye building some liquid and leaking the same as well. His friends in school took this to be funny as most kids would and decided to honor the bad eye with the name “SepticEye,” this was quite an ingenious nomenclature from them and in like manner Jack accepted it. It wasn’t too long before they figured out that the coinage of his two accepted nicknames was best for him and thus, the nickname he is famous for today – Jacksepticeye, was coined.</p><h2><strong>He Has A Few Other Endeavors That Have Contributed To His Huge Net Worth</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. He Co-owns A Clothing Line</strong></h3><p>After becoming popular, Jacksepticeye launched a clothing line in 2018.

Cloak went on to sell well even though it was quite pricy. Items made by Sean and his partners were priced between $20 and $100. In collaboration with various video game franchises and internet personalities, Cloak put out special edition collections that were further well received. In 2020, it notably partnered with Minecraft Dungeons to release a limited edition collection emblazoned with the game’s imagery. The release of the collection was timed to coincide with the release of the game’s spin-off.</p><h3><strong>2.
