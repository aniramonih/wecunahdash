"Classy, yet simple and unpretentious. Love it!" wrote one, while another said: "How is it, that if I attempted a bun it would look nothing like that!"</p><p id=eqcP68w_ZZXn data-wc=87>Hairstylist Patrick, who also counts models <a class=hm-link href=#>Kaia Gerber</a> and her mother <a class=hm-link href=#>Cindy Crawford</a> as clients, revealed in his own post that he used cult ghd styling tools to create the style. "I prepped the hair with ghd's Total Volume Mousse, and worked it into the hair with the ghd air dryer," he told HELLO!. "I then added kinks, bends and texture to the hair using the ghd Gold Styler.&nbsp;My top tip is to always make sure the front pieces are directed away from the face to frame your face shape.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=enxvwJ7BiZ7t data-wc=61>"Next I spritzed the hair with a dry texturizing hair spray to give it&nbsp;a cooler and more lived&nbsp;in feel. Using my fingers I then placed the hair into a low ponytail, feeding the ends through an elastic. On the second twist I created a loose bun, leaving the end section of the ponytail out for added length and softness.</p><p id=eWFsUMsyA8DB data-wc=62>"Then I took a small piece of hair from the underneath and wrapped it around the base of the ponytail to cover the elastic, securing with a pin," Patrick added.&nbsp;"Lastly I pulled out some pieces of the hair from around the face for extra movement and to frame the face. This made the whole look a lot more undone and wearable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37e77d2d86e5-mollie-king-lfw-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=epCPQvz_mISD data-wc=9><strong>Mollie attended the Aspinal of London fashion week show</strong></p><p id=ePT2auxGqq4f data-wc=63>Mollie completed her beauty look with natural and nude makeup, as she stepped out in a chic cream shirt dress and neutral accessories.
