She was born in Puerto Rico. As of 2023, she is 25 years old.</p><p>Early on in her life, Carmen wanted to join the Air Force. But unfortunately, Carmen had to work several different jobs due to her financial condition.</p><p>At 15, Carmen got her first job as a babysitter. After her high school graduation in 2016, she began working in a car plant.</p><p>After relocating from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles, California, Carmen Pritchett began her modeling career. However, she only began considering a career as a YouTuber after being introduced to the idea by Corey Pritchett Jr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>Carmen Pritchett <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">launched her solo YouTube channel</a> before starting her family channel. Initially, however, Queen of SSG was unsure what kind of content she wanted to create on her channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Carmen-modeling-days.jpg><p>Nevertheless, she was sure that regardless of the type of content she shared created her own loyal fanbase. So, to figure out what she wanted her channel to focus on, Carmen asked her followers what they wanted to see on her channel.</p><p>In an interview, Carmen discussed how she enjoyed making content targeted toward women and said,</p><p>“I think it’s important for me to make videos about women because I feel like, with this generation, there isn’t a lot of accessible information related to the difficulties of being a woman, experiencing pregnancy, or being a young mom. So what I do is keep it transparent, showing people that life isn’t always sweet and full of rainbows all the time. Sometimes it’s tough, and sometimes we make mistakes. In my opinion, it’s better to recognize that, do something about it, and learn from it, rather than thinking you’re not allowed to make mistakes in the first place.”</p><p>After launching her solo channel in 2018, Queen of SSG also started making videos for her and her family channel. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The popular YouTuber</a>, known for the variety of content she shares, talked about her content strategy and said in an interview,</p><p>“I like trying different content for different audiences, you know? Like, I’d hate sticking to just one type of content. I feel like that would get boring.”</p><p>Furthermore, the mother of two shared how she manages to stay relevant in the ever-growing world of YouTube,</p><p>“I like adding my spin to things that are currently trending or something that already went viral.”</p><p>Carmen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has collaborated with several reputed brands</a>, such as Flat Tummy, Fashion Nova, Savage X Fenty, What Waist, and Baddie Eville.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Carmen-Pritchett-Posing-for-Fashion-Nova.jpg><p>Talking about her growing empire and her future career plans, Carmen has expressed her desire to take her career in acting and content creation rather than just YouTube.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Carmen Pritchett Husband</h2><p>Carmen Pritchett is married to YouTuber Corey Pritchett Jr. Corey, born in May 1998, rose to popularity with his and Carmen’s joint channel named Carmen and Corey.</p><p>Moreover, Corey also has his solo YouTube channel called CoreySSG.
