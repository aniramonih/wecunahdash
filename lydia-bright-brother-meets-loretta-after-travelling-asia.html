After travelling Asia, two cancelled flights and 14 days of isolation, he is finally back at our family home," Lydia wrote next to a picture of the three of them cuddled up in her garden. She also shared the video of her handing her daughter over to Freddie for their first cuddle - and it was clearly an emotional moment for the new mother, who can be heard crying and laughing in the background as her brother cooed to Loretta. The proud uncle couldn't take his eyes off her, and gushed on his own social media: "Finally with my beautiful neice." So sweet!</p><p id=eJLqR-FEQgi data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Lydia Bright shares incredible photo taken moments after giving birth" class=hm-link href=#>Lydia Bright shares incredible photo taken moments after giving birth</a></strong></p><p id=e8HJtqWsvUGc data-wc=85>While this marked the first physical meeting, Lydia did ensure the pair met over FaceTime while her brother was away from home. In early April, she posted a picture of one of their calls and revealed steps had been taken to bring her brother home. "Loretta can’t wait to meet her uncle Fred.

The 30-year-old even revealed the sweet way her parents are preparing their home for Loretta's first summer on Instagram. Posting a video from the garden, Lydia showed her dad and sister Romana painting an outhouse she described as "Loretta's garden house" in a navy blue colour.</p><p id=eWNo49hin4Vt data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Lydia Bright reveals the covetable high street buys in her chic living room" class=hm-link href=#>Lydia Bright reveals the covetable high street buys in her chic living room</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
