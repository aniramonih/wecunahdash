I just recently got engaged,” the 30-year-old said to a screaming crowd. “Two dreams of mine have been to be a singer and be on stage like this and to have a family. In a couple of months, that’s all about to come true. I’m going to get married…”</p><p>“I’ve gotten to do some amazing things with Danity Kane, but it’s time for me to start the next chapter in my life,” she tearfully continued. “So I thank you guys from the bottom of my heart…I love you so much. And I just wanted you guys to know from me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Fimbres, who broke out in the music industry in MTV’s Making the Band in 2005, brought her step-daughter on stage during the emotional goodbye, but reassured fans that now former bandmates <a href=#><strong>Aubrey O’Day</strong></a>,<strong> Dawn Richard</strong>, and <strong>Shannon Bex</strong> had a bright future.</p><p>“They are going to kill it for you,” she said. “While I go and have some babies!” (The identity of her husband-to-be is unknown.)&nbsp;</p><p>Danity Kane reunited after splitting in 2009 at the MTV Video Music Awards last August, and confirmed their comeback. Member <strong>D. Woods</strong>, however, exclusively told <strong>Us</strong> at the time that she would <a href=#>not be rejoining</a> the female group. On May 15, they dropped their <a href=#>single “Lemonade,”</a> which Fimbres was seemingly absent from. Only three women were shown on its cover art.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmqynnKKarm6yyKaZq52jYra0ecSnnpqflZl6rbHAr6Cnn12Zrq%2B107JkpJmemnq1u4ysq5qqpGKubrLApqClsV1nfXKAkHBs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
