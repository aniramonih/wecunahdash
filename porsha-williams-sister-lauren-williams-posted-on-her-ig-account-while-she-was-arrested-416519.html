It’s been revealed that more protesters, including Porsha Williams have been earlier arrested while they were protesting for justice for Breonna Taylor.
On Dennis McKinley’s Instagram page, he posted a flyer for a peaceful protest in Louisville, Kentucky. Hours later, he uploaded footage of Porsha being escorted by a police officer.
