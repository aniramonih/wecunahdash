Farris, one of the lawyers representing Heard, said, according to ESPN. “The family would like the opportunity, through their attorneys, to investigate why and how the gun was brought to the scene of a confrontation that resulted in the death of their daughter. Once we have had the opportunity to evaluate the evidence in the case, we can make decisions about the degree of culpability, if any, of each.”</p><p>In a statement, Heard’s attorneys also said the family has questions they still want answered.</p><p>“Words will never accurately describe the heartbreak we feel in the wake of Jamea’s devastating and unnecessary death,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the statement read, per AL.com</a>. “We have several unanswered questions surrounding the events leading to the shooting death of our daughter and our is hope to get answers.”</p><p>Farris’ firm has contacted the attorneys of Davis and Miles and has also spoken to an attorney representing the Hornets, where Miller is about to begin his rookie season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/NYPICHPDPICT000007166251.jpg><p>“Am I surprised that this lawsuit has been filed? No,” Davis’ attorney John Robbins said, according to ESPN. “I haven’t reviewed the lawsuit but Michael will take the appropriate steps to defend himself in this lawsuit as he is in the criminal case.”</p><p>In a February hearing, a police investigator testified that Miller was at the scene of the crime and that the gun used in the killing of Harris came from the back of Miller’s car.</p><p>In response, Miller’s attorney, Jim Standridge, said then that Miller had <a href=#>“no knowledge of any intent to use the weapon”</a> and that he “never touched the gun” nor was involved in its “exchange.”</p><p>Standridge also said Miller never saw or handled the gun, adding that it was “concealed” under some clothing in the back seat.</p><p>Miller signed a contract in July worth $49 million over four years with Charlotte after being taken No. 2 overall in this summer’s draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlma2hfmsVurcuamZqlkWLAta3RZpmrmZ6ZvK95zKKjpZ2iYruiucSdZKKmXay%2FsLrGn6ylZZSarrW0jKWYsKulnsFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
