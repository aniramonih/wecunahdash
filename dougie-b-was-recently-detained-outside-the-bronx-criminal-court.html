After a ruckus in the E. 161st St. parking lot, he was arrested on unspecified charges.&nbsp;The incident happened as a group of guys were fighting in the parking lot. One group started pursuing the other, and a guy took out a pistol and fired a shot. However, no one was hurt in the incident, and no charges were brought.</p><p>The report was corroborated by authorities, who claimed there was a vehicle accident and that bullets were fired at one time. However, no one was harmed. The rapper was scheduled to appear in court on Thursday afternoon in connection with a separate shooting case.</p><p>A lady told The Washington Post that she overheard an altercation between a group of boys and then heard a gunshot. She continued,</p><p>“So insane that it happened directly in front of the Bronx Supreme Court?” What did they believe would happen? They weren’t going anywhere.”</p><h2>All About Dougie B</h2><p>The rapper, also known as Douglas Kieshwan Sheref Whitehead, grew up in a huge household. He remembers his father listening to and playing Nas and Jay Z songs. The 25-year-old Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, native was born on September 7, 1996. He became interested in music and started listening to musicians such as Nas, Jay-Z, Scarface, Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur, and KRS-One.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dougie-B-2.jpg alt="Dougie B" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During his adolescence, he was exposed to his uncle’s Music Development for the Youth program, where he learned the creative process of composing a song as well as how the studio equipment works. That’s when he fell in love with producing and began working on his first beat.</p><h2>More information about Dogie B’s latest arrest</h2><p>As previously stated, the rapper was held by authorities, and more details regarding the case are now unclear.&nbsp;The police have yet to provide any further information on the charges. A full investigation into the situation is now underway, and more details will be released only after that. It is unclear how long he will be held in police custody.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dougie-B-1-1.jpg alt="Dougie B" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The rapper was arrested only one day after filming a music video with Cardi B in the Bronx. Before 1 p.m., court officials and New York Daily News reporters heard one gun fired near the East 161st Street parking lot as lawyers and court personnel were leaving for lunch.&nbsp;According to a court official, cops raced across the street and arrested a large number of people. Dougie B was one of four persons who were carried away in handcuffs.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibqK2XnrJuroywmKxlopqwprrTpbBmnJWprqq6xJ1kqK2kqLalsYytn55lkqe8r8SMnKmipZmjrq15wqisq6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
