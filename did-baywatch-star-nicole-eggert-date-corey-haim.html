Whatever the case, Haim and Eggert worked together closely for a brief period when they were young, then not at all. It’s a pattern that’s familiar to fans of Bieber and Gomez from a few years ago.</p><h2 id=h-nicole-eggert-and-corey-haim-s-relationship-explained data-injectable=false>Nicole Eggert and Corey Haim’s relationship, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nicole-Eggert-and-Corey-Haim-in-Blown-Away-1.jpg><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>It should come as no surprise that Eggert and Haim did, in fact, date for a while in the ‘90s, even getting engaged before breaking things off. The two met on the set of Blown Away in 1991, around the time that Eggert was about to blow up on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baywatch</a>, and were together from 1991 to 1993.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>In the leadup to the release of Baywatch: The American Dream, a 2024 documentary series on the subject of the iconic series, Eggert spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> about her relationship with Haim. She described his early struggles with substance abuse but claimed that he didn’t try to draw her into his addictions. “(…) he wasn’t trying to get me to do anything with him,” she recalled. “It was his own private thing, which in hindsight would feel a little bit strange, but he was never trying to drag me into that.”</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>“But no,” she continued, “if he was having the shakes and freaking out in the middle of the night and wanted to go to the emergency room, I’d take him.”</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>By 1993, the two had moved in together, and Eggert says that she became overwhelmed by her partner’s erratic behavior. She called the engagement off and cut ties with Haim, but she stayed in touch with him “here and there” in the years that followed.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Despite their falling out, Eggert described Haim as a “friend forever.” Constantly entrenched in public scandals and addiction, Haim would later pass away in 2010 in Burbank, California at age 38, after briefly suffering from pneumonia. Eggert never married and has two daughters, ages 25 and 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMm5iyr5GpsKl50q2Yq2WenrCwuMRmnKCflafBbrDArZxmm5%2Bnsrp5x5qgpmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
