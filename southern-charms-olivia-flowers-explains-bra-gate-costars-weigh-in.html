I’d be lying if I said it didn’t have an effect on our friendship now, but it just depends on the day with him. I mean, he gets on my every last nerve, but I also enjoy his company, so it’s weird.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdqHqwuMivoJpllqG8uLHRrGSesKChrqq60maZq5ldnK61sYycpqyskafAbsPEop6hZZmjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
