It’s been quiet here. I’ve been quiet. In short, we are deeply hurting in our little life. As I’ve written, there is a difference between secrecy marked by shame, and privacy marked by discretion, and we are in the second category. Our family is navigating an unexpected crisis, and I’ve taken a step back from socials and work to help steer toward healing and wholeness. Please know that everyone is safe, and all our kids are okay. Also know that our community and family has radically cared for us, and we are surrounded by love and support. Jesus loves us. We are not alone. . Please don’t worry but please do pray for us if you pray. A request: don’t pry or ask or push, even out of sincere concern. Please don’t blow up our phones and inboxes and DMs (or our friends’). Just hold us close to your heart in great love. As I reengage our online community here, I’ll be whatever I am that day, so thanks for the space to be a human person. I’ve always known you were a soft place to land. Thank you for loving us in all things, at all times, through all moments.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Jen Hatmaker</a> (@jenhatmaker) on Jul 31, 2020 at 3:38pm PDT</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Brandon Hatmaker cheat on Jen Hatmaker?</h2><p>Most of Jen Hatmaker’s fans first became aware that something was up with the popular Christian speaker/blogger/TV host back in July. On Instagram, where she has more than 500,000 followers, Jen shared a post saying that her family was “navigating an unexpected crisis.” She clarified that everyone in the family was safe and asked for her followers to give her and her family some privacy.</p><p>“A request: don’t pry or ask or push, even out of sincere concern,” she wrote. “Please don’t blow up our phones and inboxes and DMs (or our friends’). Just hold us close to your heart in great love.” Jen maintained a social media presence after making this post, often hinting at the behind-the-scenes struggles in her post captions. However, it wasn’t until Sep. 7 that Jen announced exactly what the “unexpected crisis” has been.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jen (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>whose maiden name is King</u></a>) made another Instagram post saying, “We are in a moment with no handbook and without a single clue how to navigate this privately, much less publicly. I don’t know how to hide grief, so I haven't, and I am grateful for your absolute decency these last few weeks. I don’t know how to say this, and I still cannot believe I am even saying it, but Brandon and I are getting divorced.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>I first thank you for the kindness you have shown these last two months. We are in a moment with no handbook and without a single clue how to navigate this privately, much less publicly. I don’t know how to hide grief, so I haven't, and I am grateful for your absolute decency these last few weeks. I don’t know how to say this, and I still cannot believe I am even saying it, but Brandon and I are getting divorced. Although the details are ours alone, this was completely unexpected, and I remain stunned as we speak. I am shocked, grief-stricken, and broken-hearted. . Although this community is impossibly dear, beloved to me, in case you are an interloper who revels in the pain of another, I beg you to spare us your cruelty. We have suffered so greatly. (Hateful comments that harm our family will be deleted.) The kids and I are getting away to retreat for awhile, and I ask for your kindness…and for some room to breathe. Please respect the privacy of our children and our extended family. Our loss is not for public devouring. We are real people managing this in our real life in real time, and we are doing the absolute best we know how to do. . If you pray, pray for us. Hold us so dear to your hearts. We have felt your prayers these last few weeks. We have experienced your mercy. Thank you for being good to us. Know that we are deeply surrounded by love and have not been alone a single second in two months. Please help protect us and keep us safe as we try to heal and rebuild. . Yours, Jen</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Jen Hatmaker</a> (@jenhatmaker) on Sep 7, 2020 at 9:11am PDT</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When it comes to public figures — and especially when it comes to the private lives of those public figures — people often want to feel “in the know” when it comes the salacious details of their lives (even if the details are, in fact, not salacious at all). On Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, people have already started to share their own theories about what could have led to Jen to file for divorce. Namely, there are those who have theorized that Brandon had an extra-marital affair.</p><p>However, Jen did not in any way confirm these rumors in her Instagram post. “Although the details are ours alone, this was completely unexpected, and I remain stunned as we speak. I am shocked, grief-stricken, and broken-hearted.” Jen also went on to ask — again — for privacy as she and her family navigate this difficult situation. “Our loss is not for public devouring,” she wrote. “We are real people managing this in our real life in real time, and we are doing the absolute best we know how to do.”</p><p>Given Jen’s role as a public figure, there is certainly a chance that she may, at some point, share some additional details behind her and Brandon’s decision to get divorced. However, feeding into any baseless and unfounded theories when we simply don’t have the information is both fruitless and — if we’re being honest — pretty darn rude.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecGrmKecn6N6qa3TppiknaJisKmxwK0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
