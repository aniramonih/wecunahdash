For the TV, that would be classic shows like "Fantasy Island" and "Diff'rent Strokes," as well as more recent series like "ER" and "Desperate Housewives." Hudson's film credits include "Redemption," "The Crow," and "Ghostbusters: Afterlife."</p><p dir=ltr>In "Grey's Anatomy" Season 8 episode "Put Me in, Coach," Hudson played the chief of surgery for an opposing hospital Seattle Grace is playing softball against. Chief McDougall and Owen Hunt, who is acting chief at the time, go at it as coaches, talking smack during practice. During the actual game, Hudson even gets an at bat and hits a home run, complete with victory dance. Unfortunately for SG, Lexi Grey shows unsportsmanlike conduct, throwing a ball at an opposing player, and the whole thing erupts into yelling.</p><p>Interestingly, Hudson was actually being considered for the role of Chief Richard Webber, played by James Pickens Jr. Hudson told&nbsp;<a href=#>MadameNoire</a>&nbsp;that "Grey's" show creator Shonda Rhimes liked his work and had asked him to come in and read for the part. "I'm not readin', I'm sorry," Hudson said at the time, now regretting that decision. "Now, of course, it's in its tenth season and he's making a zillion dollars an episode," he quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpaYB0gY6tn55lnaTAtXnFmqSoraNisKa4xJupoqypYrS2sdKtZKyskafAbrvNZp6rnamoeqK6wK2mprFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
