Additionally, there are times when the focus changes to other members of his family. And in this particular instance, it’s the venerable Ed Rodgers himself.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Because he is a chiropractor, Aaron’s dad is well-known in the community and among his patients for relieving any forms of back pain and fostering wellness pain.</p><p>In addition to this, he has been rumored to have a contentious relationship with his famous son, which has also garnered him media attention. In addition to providing an answer to all of those questions, the following extended facts will also reveal the identity of Aaron Rodgers’ real father. Ed Rogers, who is the patriarch of the Rodgers family, was born in Brazos County, Texas in the year 1955.
