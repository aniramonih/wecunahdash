While Hollywood’s biggest names honored the evening’s “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty Explained” theme with fierce black and white gowns that paid tribute to the late designer’s love of the timeless aesthetic on the carpet — all bets were off after attendees left the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, May 1."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 27-year-old supermodel ascended the famous steps in a <a href=#>sequin bodysuit by Marc Jacobs</a>. Jenner’s ensemble was the perfect tribute to Lagerfeld as it featured a sharp collar — a look the former Chanel creative director was known for. Afterward, however, the 818 Tequila founder opted to show even more skin in a “naked” romper by Nensi Dojaka at the ApresMET Afterparty. The alluring piece featured a sparkly, sheer construction teamed with a connected high-rise thong. The garment was completed with pearl straps.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The California native hit up the soirée <a href=#>with her new beau</a>, <a href=#><strong>Bad Bunny</strong></a>, who played it cool in a white T-shirt, dark pants and cowboy boots. (The pair, who have been linked since February, walked the carpet solo.) At the Met, the “Neverita” singer, 29, looked sharp in a white textured suit by Jacquemus that was equipped with protruding flowers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> was also present at the Apres celebration, leaving little to the imagination in a mesh corset dress. She accessorized with layers of pearls and rocked a pair of platform sandal heels by Jimmy Choo. Earlier on Monday, the My Body author looked dainty in a tulle gown by Tory Burch.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Janelle Monae</strong></a>, meanwhile, brought the heat as she hosted a Met Gala afterparty in the Boom Boom Room at the Standard Hotel. The “Yoga” artist, 37, showed off her curves in a crystal-covered black bra and coordinating underwear. While on the Met carpet, her lingerie was covered by a black pannier dress. Before showing off the structural fit, she arrived in a large black-and-white tweet Thom Browne tuxedo suit. After taking a few photos, two handlers removed the outerwear to show off her barely-there clothes. She accessorized with a feline-shaped handbag — a nod to Lagerfeld’s cat Choupette.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Keke Palmer</strong></a> danced the night away at Monae’s gathering, showing off her post-baby curves in a colorful mini dress by Sergio Hudson. She styled the flirty frock with a hot pink coat and fuchsia earrings. (The Scream Queens alum, 29, <a href=#>welcomed her first child</a> — a baby boy named Leodis —&nbsp;with boyfriend <strong>Darius Jackson</strong> in February.)&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see what the stars wore to the 2023 Met Gala afterparties:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqOVo7GiuMtmoZ6mnpq%2Fbq3NnWSmp6KaeqS0wKeenmWWpL9urcWtnKuokafBqrHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
