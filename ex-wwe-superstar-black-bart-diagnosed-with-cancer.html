The pro wrestling icon had a storied career which saw him compete for promotions such as Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federation to name a few. That being said, we have an unfortunate news to share about the retired pro wrestler.</p><p>Black Bart provided an update on his health via his official Facebook account on Sunday. The former NWA National Heavyweight Champion said he’s been diagnosed with cancer and will be undergoing hemotherapy for the disease soon. The pro wrestling promised to fight stage four liver cancer “with all I have in me.”</p><p>Well I’m not quite sure where to start except to just spit it out the way I usually do. I don’t want rumors so here’s the truth. I was diagnosed today with stage 4 colon cancer that has also spread to my liver. I am not the kind to just roll over and play dead so you all should know that I will fight it with all I have in me. Since I am a child of God and He is in my heart always I believe I have a head start. I will see the oncologist next week and start chemotherapy ASAP. The main thing I ask from my Facebook people is for prayer because I believe we can all use extra prayers. I will post updates when I have them.</p><p>This is indeed a terrible news and we hope that Black Bart will pin cancer down once and for all and get back better than ever. Join us at Ringside News as we wish the wrestling legend all the very best in his fight against cancer.</p><p>What are your fondest memories from the legendary career of Black Bart?
