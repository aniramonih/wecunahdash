The most prominent theory is that she was abducted, although there is no solid evidence to support this theory.&nbsp;</p><p>LeeAnna’s father, Chris Warner, has stated that he does not believe LeeAnna Warner missing was at the hands of someone local.&nbsp;</p><p>On the night LeeAnna disappeared, thousands of people attended a concert and a motorcycle run in town, leading some to speculate that an out-of-towner may have been involved.</p><p>Despite the lack of concrete evidence, law enforcement officials have not given up on finding out what happened to LeeAnna.&nbsp;</p><p>Chisholm Police Chief Vernon Manner has stated that he believes someone knows something about the case and has urged anyone with information to come forward.&nbsp;</p><p>The St. Louis County Sheriff’s Office, which has also been involved in the case, has continued to investigate leads as they come in.</p><p>One lead that was followed up on involved a neighbor who saw LeeAnna make it to her friend’s house.&nbsp;</p><p>Police would later question 24-year-old Matthew Curtis, who lived down the street.</p><p><strong>“All the agencies that worked on the case would’ve liked to have followed up with Matt,”</strong> St. Louis County Sheriff Ross Litman said in 2018. <strong>“To try to determine what, if any, involvement he had. Unfortunately, that ended when he took his own life.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>While this development was a setback, investigators have continued to pursue other leads. Another lead involved LeeAnna’s footprints, which were found near Chisholm’s Lake.</p><p>Police initially thought this could be a break in the case, but it turned out to be from another day, and partially draining the lake turned up nothing.</p><p>LeeAnna’s parents have also been vocal in their efforts to find their daughter. They have made desperate televised pleas in hopes of seeing her again.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;“Beaner, come home. We miss you. We’re not going to stop looking for you. We’re not going to sleep until we find you. We love you,” </strong>they said in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LeeAnna-Warner-missing-2-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Leanna Warner found?</h2><p>Through the years, they have remained hopeful that LeeAnna will return to their <a href=#>family</a>.</p><p><strong>“It’s like getting punched in the gut. I don’t know, how do you explain it? Your life just stops,”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>LeeAnna’s father, Chris Warner, said in an interview. The disappearance of a child can be a traumatic experience for parents, and it is no surprise that Chris and Kaelin have been deeply affected by what happened to their daughter.</p><p>While the case remains unsolved, there have been some developments in recent years that offer hope that it may eventually be solved.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the continued efforts of law enforcement officials and the public to keep the case in the public eye could lead to someone coming forward with information that could finally break the case wide open.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LeeAnna Warner missing case received National Attention</h2><p>For many years, the disappearance of LeeAnna Warner has been a closely watched case by residents of Chisholm.&nbsp;</p><p>The story gained national attention when it was featured on ‘America’s Most Wanted’ and ‘People Magazine’ as they tried to uncover what happened to the young girl.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the attention, the case remains unsolved, and in 2020, Chisholm Police Chief Vern Manner revealed that there are several persons of interest in the case who cannot call suspects due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>Later, in August 2021, the ‘True Crime Garage’ podcast released a two-part series about LeeAnna’s Warner missing.&nbsp;</p><p>The first part of the series detailed the events surrounding the young girl’s disappearance, while the second part focused on potential suspects in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these efforts, Kaelin Whittaker, LeeAnna’s mother, passed away on December 10, 2022, without ever receiving answers about her daughter’s disappearance.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC4xJ6Yp6aRYsSivs2eqWalmajAqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
