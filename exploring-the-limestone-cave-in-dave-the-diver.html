Before embarking on this daring expedition, it is essential to upgrade your gear repeatedly to ensure your safety. This precaution is vital as the cave is home to a variety of aggressive fish that will relentlessly pursue you unless you are adequately equipped to defend yourself.</span></p><p><span>Entering this perilous domain requires careful consideration. Nevertheless, as you progress through the game’s narrative, a visit to the Limestone Cave becomes inevitable. Not only will you be tasked with collecting an array of fish for the sushi bar, but you will also need to procure specific items for the quest titled “Where the Currents Flow.” Keeping these objectives in mind, here is a comprehensive guide to locating the Limestone Cave and surviving its challenges.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Where to Find the Limestone Cave in Dave The Diver</strong></span></h2><p><span>Pinpointing the precise location of the Limestone Cave in Dave the Diver may vary based on your individual map. However, it is typically positioned near the center of the map, requiring you to descend to a depth of around 70 meters. Upon arrival, you will encounter strong water currents that push you in various directions. Exercise caution around the spikes jutting out from the cave walls, as they pose a threat if not navigated carefully. Additionally, be wary of the hostile fish that populate this region.</span></p><p><span>Mastering the art of timing is crucial to navigating the currents safely. These currents operate intermittently, providing windows of opportunity to progress past them unscathed. While the timing may be tight, take a moment to observe the cycles and familiarize yourself with the periods of relative calm.</span> <span>If you are in search of quest items, keep an eye out for chests marked with yellow exclamation points.</span></p><p><span>If a chest happens to be in the path of a water current, you will have a brief window to open it before being swept away. Subsequently, during the ensuing lull, you can return to retrieve the contents of the chest.</span></p><h2><span><strong>About Dave The Diver</strong></span></h2><p><span>Dive into the captivating world of Dave the Diver, an enthralling adventure game developed by Mintrocket.
