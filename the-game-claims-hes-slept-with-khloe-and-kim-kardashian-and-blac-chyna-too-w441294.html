Now, did you get down with Kourtney?” Williams continued.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The Game said “no” to Kourtney, and when Williams moved on to Kim, he replied: “You know what, this is what I’ll say. I’ll tell you this. Kanye is a really good friend of mine. And they got really, really beautiful kids, and I don’t want to disrespect their family.”</p><p>Williams then jokingly asked The Game if he had sex with momager Kris or Kendall and Kylie before the rapper finally confessed that the third woman was <b>Rob Kardashian</b>’s fiancée — and Kardashian-to-be — <b>Blac Chyna</b>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It gets a little tricky. Chyna ain’t married yet,” he told the talk show host. “It’s all good, you know what I’m saying? It’s facts.”</p><p>As previously reported by <i>Us,</i> the other two are seemingly Kim and possibly Khloé.</p><p>The <i>Strong Looks Better Naked</i> author was linked to the rapper following her split from ex-husband <b>Lamar Odom</b>, but The Game denied they were ever romantically involved. Kim briefly dated the rapper years ago prior to marrying husband <b>Kanye West</b>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVitKK5xGaapZmZosButMSsZKyklaXBbsPIrZ9mo5ihvKZ5wKebZqOZonqsrdGdmKygmZa7bq3NnWSbpJGYeqS02KeYZqyfpHq4gJNqaXJsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
