After being trapped in an arranged marriage for years, Lady Danbury asserted her position in the Ton and chose to chart her own path rather than marry again. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Arsema Thomas</strong></a> (she/they) about if she’d want to expand on Lady Danbury’s story in a spinoff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/arsema-thomas-QUEEN-CHARLOTTE-Netflix-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Uh, yes. Yes, I would. I think working with this crew has been such a massive blessing that I think if they make that decision then I trust them,” Arsema told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> at the Queen Charlotte event at the Paley Center for Media on May 4. “Whatever decision that they make I am going to constantly trust them. So if they think there’s a story where there’s more to be told with Agatha, I’m happy to be on that ride.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Following the death of Lord Danbury, Agatha grew closer to Lord Ledger, Violet Bridgerton’s father. They developed a deep and intimate bond, which resulted in a brief affair. Arsema believes Lady Danbury’s relationship with Lord Ledger was the first time she’d ever been truly in love.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“In a way, she loved Herman [Danbury]. There is something that you just build with somebody after you’ve been with them, gosh, like 20 years,” the 28-year-old said. “And then to be with somebody [Lord Ledger] who looks at her in a different way and talks to her like an intellectual being and not just a woman, whatever that meant in the Georgian era, I think is probably a different type of love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The actress added, “She gets to love him out of her own decision-making, and I think that kind of then gives her the confidence to say no to Adolphus. She realizes that maybe I don’t actually have to be with a man at all, so she takes his rejection on the chin so to speak. I don’t know if he’s the love of her life but definitely a catalyst in her becoming the woman that she is in Bridgerton.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/queen-charlotte-corey-mylchreest-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>There are many years between the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>events of Queen Charlotte</a> and the first season of Bridgerton. Arsema believes that Lady Danbury does find love again, but it may not be solely romance. “It’s so strange. I think we only think about love as something that can only happen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the romantic sense</a>, and I think she has realized that she has so much love for so many other people,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Queen Charlotte</a> is one of those people. “That is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>true love</a> that she realizes, and when she notices that this type of friendship love fulfills her in the same amount that a romantic partnership does, she would rather go with that, and then get the sexual pleasure from wherever she wants,” Arsema said. Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49xZqqtlZq7bq%2FHmqmlp6Spsm64wJ2wZpyRo6%2B2vthmqqmhnqSzp3nLqKmdZZyasaix0Wagp6yVp8OqsdZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
