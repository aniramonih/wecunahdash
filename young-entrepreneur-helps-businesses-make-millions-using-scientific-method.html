How did you get to where you are today?</strong></p><p>My name is Rufaro Nyamaharo and I’m 26 years old born and raised in Zimbabwe. I got to move to the United States for college and that’s when my whole view of the world changed. Before I just wanted to get my degree and go work for someone else but after getting to rub shoulders and make friends with people as young as 21 who were running companies that we’re changing lives in the world I quickly had a shift in mindset. I wanted to help people too and had to do it the best way I knew how, by using the internet somehow. At the time I was doing a minor in marketing and the subject would just fascinate me so I decided to start exploring how I could use technology in the industry. After hours of learning, hours of trial and error I finally learned the one secret marketers didn’t want businesses to know, how they were making millions month after month. I wanted to share this knowledge with other companies so I decided to start Pixel Perfect Media. I was lucky to land Netflix star Jaylen Barron after sending her a DM and proposing she let me work on her advertising. She was actually looking for someone to do her marketing and she gave me a shot and the rest is history. We’ve been friends since then and have made each other a lot of money working together on different projects.</p><p><strong>What challenges have you had to overcome along the way?</strong></p><p>My biggest challenge was actually figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. It actually took me a long time to come to figure that out but once I did things have started to take shape. Running a business has also not been a walk in the park because it’s such a big responsibility knowing that your employees and their families are betting on you to make things work but I love it. I’ve built a great team and they make the job a whole lot easier.</p><p><strong>What do you specialize in and why should someone work with you over the competition?</strong></p><p>I help businesses scale to 6 & 7 figures using a scientific method. We take a deep dive into your business and learn about your goals then we create a marketing plan that gives you the greatest chances of success but the best part of it all is we go ahead and implement it too while our clients just relax. They can easily keep track of how much they are spending and how much they are making with the tap of a finger.</p><p><strong>What’s your best piece of advice for readers who desire to find success in their life?</strong></p><p>Think Big</p><p>Find what you love to do and do exactly that</p><p>Fail fast and keep going</p><p>You decide what you want your life to be at the end of it all</p><p><strong>Speaking of success, what does the word mean to you?</strong></p><p>Success is being able to work in your own unique genius, and impact the life of another person… or, if you’re really successful, millions of people.</p><p>To me it’s always been about freedom, I love being able to do what I want when I want to. Being able to spend more time with the people close to me has been the biggest driving factor for me. It’s different for everyone that’s what I’ve started to notice</p><p><strong>What’s next for you?</strong></p><p>My goal is to scale my agency to 7 figures in the next coming years. I’ve also challenged myself to help 1000 businesses scale to 6 figures because I think that knowledge is nothing if you can’t help other people achieve their goals. Like before I do hope that I get better and better with my personal development so that I keep growing as a person.</p><p><strong>Finally, how can people connect with you if they want to learn more.</strong></p><p>Instagram- Therealrafta</p><p>LinkedIn- Rufaro Nyamaharo</p><p>Website- <a href=#>www.Pixelperfectmedia.us</a><br>What are your thoughts?
