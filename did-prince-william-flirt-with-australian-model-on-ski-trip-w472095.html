Occasionally, dad has to let his hair down! It was all clean, harmless fun.”</p><p>The source denied reports that William, 34, left his wife, <b><a href=#>Duchess Kate</a></b>, alone in London with their children, Prince George, 3, and Princess Charlotte, 22 months, adding, “Kate knew he was going away on this trip. They’re hardworking parents.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><a href=#><i>The Sun</i></a> reported that William was the only major member of the royal family to skip the annual Commonwealth Day service in exchange for drinks at the mountainside restaurant La Vache with Taylor, 24, and her friend, along with his close pals&nbsp;<b>Guy Pelly</b>, <b>James Meade</b> and <b>Tom Van Straubenzee</b>. A source told the outlet, “If I were Kate, I wouldn’t be very pleased to see my husband living it up with two stunning girls.”</p><p>Later on Monday, the prince was spotted dancing at a nightclub in Verbier, Switzerland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sophie-turner-inline-44333532-4770-429b-af8c-15f16e52d25b.jpg><p>Taylor, for her part, is in a serious relationship with chef&nbsp;<b>Aaron Goodfellow</b>. A source tells <i>Us, </i>“She is horrified that the newspaper tried to give the story this tone to a high-five amongst a group of friends at a public bar. There was no flirting.”</p><p>Back at Westminster Abbey, in London, William’s brother,&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Prince Harry</a></b>, and grandmother <b><a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a></b> were joined by <b><a href=#>Prince Charles</a></b>, <b><a href=#>Prince Philip</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Duchess Camilla</a></b>, among other royals, to celebrate the Commonwealth of Nations. William and Kate, 35, attended the ceremony last year and in 2015, when Kate was pregnant with Charlotte.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source close to William tells <i>Us</i> the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were never scheduled to attend this year’s engagement.
