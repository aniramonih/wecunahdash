Though he allegedly left in the spring the following year, Timothee's legacy at the campus apparently lived on. In 2018, a rumor started to spread that the young actor had a sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>"Mutual friend got chlamydia from Timothee Chalamet, pass it on," a person tweeted at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The ongoing rumor is that the award-winning actor had spread chlamydia throughout the NYU campus. Seriously, people...?</p><p>"Timothée Chalamet spread chlamydia across the NYU campus and all I’m saying is that it’s one pill and I’m in the east village <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealChalamet</a>," a fan tweeted. Though nothing was ever confirmed, the rumor continues to surface a few times each year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thinking about how I found out Timothée Chalamet gave a whole a-- class at my school chlamydia," tweeted this person. Additionally, someone wrote, "Was informed last night that timothee chalamet caused a chlamydia outbreak at nyu and idk how to feel about it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"How did i not know about the timothee chalamet chlamydia," a person wrote. "People are talking s--t on him all day every day and i didn’t know that he started a chlamydia outbreak at NYU??? this is important information."&nbsp;</p><p>This fan tweeted, "Timothée Chalamet apparently has chlamydia and I don't even care i will pay him to give it to me because that’s how hot he is."&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not the only rumor that has recently circulated about the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans tried to cancel Timothée Chalamet.</h2><p>As the world continues to practice social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems gossip is slow ... so people are inventing their own rumors and attempting to spread it across Twitter and TikTok.</p><p>Recently, an old clip of Timothee surfaced, which shows the actor reciting a line from a John Patrick Shanley play. During the table read, he says a homophobic slur, which was taken out of context.</p><p>The anti-gay slur was said because it is a line in the play Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p>And, fans have not stopped there. The hashtag #TimothéeChalametIsOverParty went viral after old photos of the actor kissing Selena Gomez resurfaced on TikTok. The pics were from the Woody Allen film A Rainy Day in New York. So, the two are not dating nor are they in a relationship; they were filming a movie together.&nbsp;</p><p>While we get the Timothée hype, the rumors about his personal life should cease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3Mnqtmm5ihrq7Fw6KY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
