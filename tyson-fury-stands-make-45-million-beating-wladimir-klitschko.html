Like most fighters, Fury said that he doesn't do it for the money, he does it for the glory."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But&nbsp;he is probably pretty happy with the amount of money he stands to make, in addition to earning the WBO, IBF, and WBA title belts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177629 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-499077514.jpg alt="PATRIK STOLLARZ/AFP/Getty Images" width=900 height=618 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177629 class=wp-caption-text>PATRIK STOLLARZ/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Final numbers have not yet been shared, but the 4:1 underdog made £5 million ($7.5 million) just for taking part in the fight. After pay-per-view numbers and ticket sales are tabulated, he stands to make over £30 million ($45 million) for his unanimous decision win over Klitschko.&nbsp;Not a bad day's wage for a 27-year-old.</p><p>The odds were not as steep as they were for <a href=# title="Andre Berto Net Worth">Andre Berto</a> to beat Mayweather, but he was not expected to beat his 39-year-old opponent. Klitschko had not lost since his 2004 fight against Lamon Brewster (5th round TKO).</p><p>As confident as he was in his chances to beat the longtime champ, even some of his family members did not think he could do it. One wealthy relative even bet Fury £200,000 that he would lose to Klitschko. So along with the £30 million ($45 million), he also took home another £200,000 ($300,000) from his relative.</p><p>As good as his take for this fight was, he stands to make even more in the rematch. Klitschko has already activated the clause in his contract that allows him to get a rematch in the event that he&nbsp;were to lose.&nbsp;The fight is expected to take place next May, at Wembley stadium. Just for taking the fight, Fury will make £15 million ($22.7 million). After ticket sales and pay-per-view buys are factored in, he stands to make as much as £50 million ($75.6 million) in what will be the richest fight in British boxing history.</p><p>So while the glory in defeating a heavy weight champion that had held the belts for 11 years is great, the pay day isn't half bad either (and will be even better the next time they fight).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2wrKeeYrO2vthmqq2ZnpnAbrnApJxmbGViuqq4y6Kmp2WSmq61tc2gZLCkkZm2rrXRZqKloaSosKm3zmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
