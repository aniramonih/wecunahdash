The 37-year-old looked unrecognizable as she posed in a black bra and pajama bottoms, with her new blue hair cascading down her chest. 
Megan looked worlds away from her usual glam appearance, forgoing her overlined lips and smokey eyes for a more natural look."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"So, I don't take surgery lightly and therefore I've not had many of them because of that.

"I've never had a facelift of any kind, no lateral brow lift although I would like one!" she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUTrHkgsc6hU data-wc=38>"No regular brow lift, I've never done threads. That's not because of some moral thing, I just don't really believe they work and I'm also afraid that they would interfere when I do need to have a facelift."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bfd71de48635-megan-fox-makeup-free.jpg><p id=eI7F1unmmN data-wc=27>She also rubbished reports that she has had liposuction and her buccal fat removed: "I've never had that done I'll never have any fat removed," she stated.&nbsp;</p><p id=eueLUXj3Sb data-wc=48>"I'm a very like lean person that doesn't have enough body fat or fat in my face so I will only ever put fat in.
