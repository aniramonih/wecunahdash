By 1972, its number of locations (1,200) was surpassed only by McDonald's (1,600) .In 1968, General Foods Corporation purchased the chain and continued its rapid expansion. By 1969, international expansion was underway with General Foods building ten Burger Chef outlets in Australia. The expansion ended in 1975 with a US$1.3 million loss.</p><p>The chain had two mascots: Burger Chef, voiced by Paul Winchell, and Jeff (the chef's juvenile sidekick).</p><p>In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to the Canadian company Imasco, which also owned Hardee's, for US$44 million (equivalent to $133.43 million in 2022).I Imasco converted many locations to Hardee's restaurants and let franchises and locations near existing Hardee's locations convert to other brands.Remaining restaurants that did not convert to Hardee's or new names and branding simply closed.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 15</td><td class=timestamp><span>November 18, 2023 3:24 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Burger Chef restaurant to be razed 45 years after unsolved murders.</p><p>A lingering vestige of the notorious unsolved Burger Chef murders 45 years ago in Speedway will soon be obliterated.</p><p>The free-standing building at 5725-5735 Crawfordsville Road is being demolished and replaced by a dental office.</p><p>“It’s been a couple of shops over the years that never caught on for more than a couple months and we’ve talked about redeveloping over time but that hasn’t happened,” said Speedway Town Council President Vince Noblet.</p><p>Ruth Shelton’s sister, Theresa Jefferies, was 12 when the killings occurred.
