Denpa Shnen (January 1998 — March 2002), a Japanese reality television show on Nippon Television. He was obliged to participate mail-in contests until he earned a total of $1 million (about $10,000). He had nothing (including no clothing), was shut off from outside connection and broadcasting, and had nothing but magazines to keep him company.&nbsp;</p><p>He earned a new Guinness world record for the “greatest period surviving on competition wins” after taking 335 days to attain his goal. Nasubi lived in front of the camera, surrounded by the sweepstakes prizes he had won and piles of postcards he had received for joining the sweepstakes. When Nasubi was standing on camera, an eggplant cartoon design was intentionally used due to his nudity. Nasubi means “eggplant” in Japanese, and the moniker was given to him because of his 30 cm long and bony face, which slants like an eggplant.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>When he arrived at his destination, he was blinded and dressed and led to a secret place. Nasubi walked along with a smile on his face, certain that he would be rewarded for his efforts. He awoke in South Korea, where he was escorted around the city and transported to an apartment after being blindfolded. He was stripped of his garments once again and compelled to join sweepstakes, this time in the hopes of winning enough money to return home.&nbsp;</p><p>The agony lasted 15 months, during which time his chronicles about being isolated from the rest of the world became a great seller in Japan. Nasubi was unable to flourish in the TV variety industry, despite the rigours he went through to become a great comic. Instead, he established himself as a local talent in Fukushima as well as a dramatic theatre performer, forming the stage group Eggplant Way, which now plays across Japan. He has appeared in Densha Otoko, Trick, Atashinchi no Danshi, and most recently in Kamen Rider W as Watcherman.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2>Nasubi Net Worth : $ 1.5 Million</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Nasubi Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Nasubi ‘s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Nasubi Wiki</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1975-01-01</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Nasubi</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Nasubi FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Nasubi get so rich?</li><li>What is Nasubi Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Nasubi Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Nasubi make per day?</li><li>How much Nasubi Net Worth ?</li><li>How Nasubi become rich ?</li><li>How does Nasubi make money ?</li><li>What is Nasubi Income ?</li><li>How much Nasubi Salary ?</li><li>How old is Nasubi Age ?</li><li>How tall is Nasubi Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfY6nmKytkp56r7HTZq6oqqSdeqq6wqiknmWjlrmivthmnJqqnp67qL%2BMm6Con6KWvanFjKGmsGWdqrCpecyopZ6xXaKurLGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
