The famed television personality apparently stopped breathing during the routine procedure and was in need of immediate medical attention. She’s been in the hospital since this happened last Thursday, and she remains there in serious condition.</p><p>The hilarious television host was originally classified as someone in critical condition, but she has been upgraded to stable condition. She’s currently in a medically induced coma to help her recover. Her daughter, Melissa Rivers, has been by her side throughout her stay at the hospital. Over the weekend Melissa Rivers updated her mother’s fans and well-wishers on her mother’s condition.</p><p>“My mother would be so touched by the tributes and prayers that we have received from around the world. Her condition remains serious but she is receiving the best treatment and care possible. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts as we pray for her recovery,” said Melissa Rivers over the weekend.</p><p>The 81-year-old comedian was fine in the days leading up to her procedure, giving no indication to her fans or colleagues or family that her health was in question. Just the day before her surgery she was out and about promoting her new book and keeping her fans in stitches with her hilarious commentary and witty comebacks. What occurred to cause her to stop breathing during her vocal cord surgery remains a mystery, but it seems that the host and author is doing all right despite her current situation. The family has kept the media up-to-date regarding Rivers’ condition, which means that they could announce any change to her condition at anytime. In the meantime, fans are continuing to pray for their favorite Fashion Police star.</p><p>(Photo by Andy Kropa/Getty Images for LensCrafters)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiknqSZqMCiedGirZ6qo2LCsbDArZysZZaWu7R5yaiYp2WinsOmvtJmn56ZnKm1br%2FTmquuq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
