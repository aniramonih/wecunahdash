Murdaugh was seen as a “family man” and a stoic representative of the upper echelon of South Carolina. But we can now see that his façade is on shaky ground thanks to years of cover-ups, corruption, and other schemes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In case you’re on the fence of who to pull for in this weekend’s Clemson vs SCar game, just remember that Alex Murdaugh was a Gamecock. 🤷🏻</p><p>🐅🐅🐅🐅🐅 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p9IADvrnDp</a></p>— Adam Eargle (@adameargle) <a href=#>November 22, 2021</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many different facets of Murdaugh’s life played into his public persona that could have also led to his downfall. His former best friend, Chris Wilson, testified that Murdaugh played football for the University of South Carolina, where he suffered a knee injury. Before all of this came to light, the media was aware of Murdaugh’s traditional past: He followed in his family’s footsteps to attend USC, played Gamecock football, hunted, fished, and boated in the S.C. Lowcountry.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#AlexMurdaugh</a> in tears as his best friend describes him as a family man… after talking about missing money.</p><p>“Alex number one priority was his family”<br>🦌Hunting<br>🏈 Football Games<br>🏀 Basketball Games<br>🌊 Beach House</p><p>Is Wilson’s testimony more helpful to defense or prosecution? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WYRIefok96</a></p>— Matt Johnson (@MattJohnsonNEWS) <a href=#>February 9, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Murdaugh then went on to practice civil law at his family’s firm, work as a volunteer solicitor under his father, and eventually take over as the family’s patriarch while continuing to practice law in the state of South Carolina.
