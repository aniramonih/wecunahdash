She is smart, elegant and poised at all times, so imagine our surprise at finding out she is also a dork just like most of us. A photo of a young Blake from a 1997 Spice Girls concert has resurfaced and her Baby Spice look - complete with&nbsp;towering platform&nbsp;shows - has us floored.</p><p>The throwback photo of the&nbsp;30-year-old ‘A Simple Favor’ star was shared by&nbsp;Twitter user @briamadrid, who had&nbsp;attended the same concert as Blake. The fan, then&nbsp;5-years-old, had taken a photo with a girl dressed as Baby Spice, with no&nbsp;premonition&nbsp;that the very girl would grow up to be THE Blake Lively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Recently,&nbsp;Bria Madrid dug up the old picture, only to put two and two together, and realized that the Baby Spice impersonator was in fact, Blake. She shared the picture with this sweet caption:&nbsp;"Found a picture when I was 5 at my first concert. #SpiceGirls&nbsp;and took a picture with a girl dressed up as Baby Spice who I just realized now was @blakelively."&nbsp;</p><p>The photo garnered the attention of Blake, who copped up: “My secret is out...”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This already exciting story did not end there. Blake shared the same picture on her Instagram page along with the caption,&nbsp;"Pretending to be someone else... since 1997 (Thanks @briaaamadrid&nbsp;for the photo of us at the Spice Girls concert. Sorry -not sorry- I tricked you into thinking I was @emmaleebunton)."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This picture caught the attention of Baby Spice herself, who responded to the picture with “So cute, you're rocking those pigtails." Obviously, a Spice Girl fan for life, Blake could not contain her excitement at catching the attention of Emma. She replied, "I'm officially [dead]. Forever bowing down to you. I cannot believe you know who I am. This will never be normal.”&nbsp;</p><p>Can we just take a breath and appreciate the fact that celebrities, they truly are – dorky – just like us!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompyWuKZ5y6KtnqSpYsGpvs6wmZqbm2K9qq%2FTrqmeZZGoeqOtwbJkrKiZmLJussCnZKmgn6m8bn2Ycm4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
