Their chemistry was undeniable, but the two always kept it professional, and Sharna even opened up about the reason why they weren’t dating to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Weekly</a> in August 2017.</p><p>We met and had incredible chemistry and neither of us were against it. But I was the coach and he was the student. Our dynamic changed. I don’t know if I’d be able to be romantic on one side and then the boss on the other. It never got to be a romance.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>So yeah, that was all that they got to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bolton Had Asked&nbsp;Normani Kordei For A Date&nbsp;</h2><p>Bonner Bolton's&nbsp;whirl of romance does not end with rumors with&nbsp;Sharna Burgess. While his rumors with&nbsp;Burgess still going on,&nbsp;Bolton asked the 'Fifth Harmony' singer, Normani Kordei out on a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">date</a> while he was in the middle of a Facebook Live interview in May 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At that time, the model had stopped by ET's Los Angeles studio for a Facebook Live <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;ahead of his appearances at &nbsp;Las Vegas' Helldorado Days Festival. And while discussing his dating life and his preferred lady for the date, he named&nbsp;Normani and expressed that he would love to go on a date with her.</p><p>You know what, I love that girl. She is just so beautiful inside and out, when she walks in the room, the whole room lights up.&nbsp;She is such a sweetheart and [was] an encouragement to me the whole time I was there. She's obviously the top performer that came on the show, who's out there killin' it in her real life every day. I respect her and admire her a whole lot, and I really am thankful she asked me to be a part of her number, that was super special.</p><p>In the end,&nbsp;Bolton&nbsp;asked&nbsp;Normani if she would go on a date with him. He asked, "Normani, will you go out on a date with me?" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I don't know, we'll see what she says. Hopefully she's watching.&nbsp;Normani, it would be an honor to go on a date with you ma'am.</p><p>To everyone's surprise,&nbsp;Normani <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accepted</a> the proposal&nbsp;while chatting with ET a few days later at the Igo.live social media launch party at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Wednesday. She said, "No, we haven't been on the date yet but when I'm in Texas, I think he's in Texas right now, I don't know. We'll have to link up."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Although both showed their willingness, the date&nbsp;never happened. Or maybe it’s just that we weren’t aware and they had a date in secret.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since then,&nbsp;professional bull rider Bonner Bolton hasn’t been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen</a> with anyone that could swirl dating rumors, which has some people wondering if he is a closeted gay and many doubting that he is secretly married. But he hasn’t bothered to address any rumors, and the women are definitely not ready to settle with the aforementioned rumors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bonner Bolton’s Bio Reveals His Passion For Bull Riding From Young Age</h2><p>The Odessa native Bonner Bolton was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on&nbsp;June 1, 1987, to parents Toya and Sally Bolton. He learned to train horses on a ranch that his family has owned since 1903 and is located between Odessa and Gardendale.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bonner approached his father about riding a bull and joined the junior rodeo at the age of 10. He spent 14 years bull riding competing on the CBR tour from 2005 to 2013 and qualified for the CBR world championship finals five times before finally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">winning</a> the World Championship in 2007.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It wasn’t long before Bonner competed on the PBR circuit in 2007 and competed in the Velocity Tour event at the Yakima Valley Sundome in 2015 when he won with a high 90.5 point ride. He reached into the top 35 of the PBR World Standing as he stood at the height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.8 meters).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And his bull riding career took a turn in 2015 when WME/IMG, now Endeavor, signed an agreement to acquire the Professional Bull Riders which led to photographer Cass Bird taking portraits of the bull riders at the world championship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In May 2016, IMG Models took notice of Bonner and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signed</a> him to a global modeling contract. Since then, he has posed for Saks Fifth Avenue and has even gone shirtless for a Br4ss underwear campaign.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikqJyVoXyju82nnKtlkqS5tbvNZqSaqqKesqV5xqKppZ6inrKvsIygmLJmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
