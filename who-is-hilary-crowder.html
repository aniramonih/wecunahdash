Steven used to be famous for showing off his wife in front of his <a href=# rel=noopener>1.3 million Instagram followers</a>. In 2021, he revealed that Hilary has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) by posting hospital images of her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hilary-Crowder-with-Her-Husband.jpg><p>Muscle weakness or paralysis may develop as a result of nerve cell injury in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Hilary appears to value her privacy, despite the fact that Steven’s political commentary channel, Louder with Crowder, has over 5.9 million subscribers.</p><p>He is particularly well-known for his one-of-a-kind “Change My Mind” segment in which he displays a placard and sets up a table, encouraging viewers to convince him otherwise on a given topic.</p><h2><strong>Hilary Crowder’s Personal Life</strong></h2><p><strong>After three months of relationship and engagement, Hilary finally tied the knot with Steven on August 25, 2012. </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>In a FOX News interview</a>, her husband said:</p><p>“Our wedding was perfect. The night of our wedding was perfect in every way. Concerned that you’re being evaluated harshly? I really don’t give a damn. What’s the reason? Because my wife and I were constantly scrutinized by others during our marriage.”</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“Everyone made fun of the young, chaste, innocent Christian couple. A wedding would be impossible for us to attend without schtupping and if we did, our wedding night would be awkward and terrible. It turns out that everyone was completely wrong.”</p><p>On April 25, 2023, Steven shared the news that he and Hilary had decided to divorce. <a href=# rel=noopener>During an episode of Louder with Crowder</a>,&nbsp;Crowder said:</p><p>“I have been living with the proverbial boot on my neck for going on years now. Since 2021, when my divorce began to get very awful, I feel like I’ve had a literal boot on the back of my neck. Crowder specified that there was no cheating or physἰcal vἰolence on either side of the split that ended his marriage.”</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“No, this wasn’t anything I opted for rather my ex-wife made the decision that she no longer wanted to be married which is legal in Texas.”</p><p><strong>In the post below, we covered information about their divorce, if you want to get more updates you can check out the below post:</strong></p><p>For the most up-to-date information about Hilary Crowder, including details about her personal life, professional life, career, early life, and more, be sure to <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgaXxzhI6wn6hlmah6qbXLmqmyZZOnvLiwxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
