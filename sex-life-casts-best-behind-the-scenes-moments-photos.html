That’s not called work.’ … [As a group,] we instantly had chemistry.”</p><p>Vogel revealed that they filmed the project, which is <a href=#>based on <strong>BB Easton</strong>’s novel 44 Chapters About 4 Men</a>, amid the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns, which helped strengthen their bond as a crew.</p><p>“In a way, it was a bit of a blessing, because the four of us were the only people we could hang out with during that time — to stay separated from everyone else and stay healthy,” the Brave alum told <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> the same month. “It creates this trust.”</p><p>Vogel noted that the <a href=#>steamy sex scenes</a> between him and his fellow actors also began pretty quickly, which again brought them closer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Literally day two, we were into filming an intimate scene right off the bat. You’re doing so much of it over the course of the show that by the time we finished, everyone’s throwing our clothes at us,” he joked. “And we’re like, ‘No, no, we’re good.’ You see how those inhibitions come down over the course of filming something like this.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Sex/Life’s four leading actors sweetest behind-the-scenes moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bosrl5y6KdnmWTlsC1v4ybnKysXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwKSxzZ6qZqWforKvwNJmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
