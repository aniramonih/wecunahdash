The sergeant's death marked the first time in 17 seasons that the crime procedural killed off an inner member of the squad, though Mike had admittedly been a new addition, having joined SVU earlier that season following Olivia Benson's promotion to lieutenant."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Gary ends up holding his wife and the sergeant hostage at gunpoint, and when Dodds Jr. tries to grab his gun at one point, he ends up being shot in the shoulder.</p><p>Things get especially tragic at this point because, once at the hospital, everyone — from viewers to his own dad — thinks Mike is about to make a full recovery, and it's not until his fiancée comes to visit him that Benson realizes Mike's having trouble making sense and slurring his words.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A doctor ultimately informs Mike's dad that his son has sustained a brain hemorrhage and that he won't recover. It's a super somber moment that sees Chief Dodds (Peter Gallagher) breaking down in Olivia's arms, and Olivia, in turn, doesn't even have to utter a word to the rest of her squad for them to understand the magnitude of the tragedy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following his tragic and untimely death, Mike is given a hero's funeral for which the whole team dresses up in full police uniform. Afterward, they remember their fallen colleague at a wake in an Irish pub.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Andy Karl leave the show?</h2><p>As fans know, Mike's death is a big reason that Carisi (Peter Scanavino) sticks around the squad for another few seasons, despite the fact that he passes his bar exam around this time.&nbsp;</p><p>But it turns out that the reason SVU lost a main member for the first time in 17 seasons is that actor Andy Karl took a role in a musical.&nbsp;He played the lead in the musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, first in London, then on Broadway.</p><p>As showrunner Warren Leight jokingly explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a>, "I liked Andy, I loved working for Andy. We gave him more and more and he got stronger and stronger, but he's going to do a musical. When I heard he got a musical I said, 'Oh, you're going to catch a bullet.'"</p><p>Catch new episodes of Law & Order: SVU, Thursdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOonKxlnZ64pnnDqJudq12ZtqZ50q%2Bs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
