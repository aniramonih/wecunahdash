It's an unwritten rule that every leading lady in a wanderlust-filled rom-com series must have an equally attractive and debonair leading man. Thankfully, Netflix was like, &#34;We got you, fam&#34; when they cast Eugenio Mastrandrea as Zoe Saldana's love interest in the latest limited romantic series From Scratch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So far, there appears to be no trace there or anywhere else of a gorgeous Italian wife or girlfriend by his side.</p><p>However, many actors with large followings (Eugenio currently has 35,000 followers and counting) understandably choose not to post about their romantic lives on social media. In other words, just because Eugenio hasn't posted about a wife or girlfriend doesn't actually mean he's single. Or it could mean that he's single and we might have a shot!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>Eugenio Mastrandrea on the set of 'From Scratch'</p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The 28-year-old Italian actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tudum</a> that he felt a great responsibility to tell the story of From Scratch author <a href=#>Tembi Locke's</a> late husband Saro (who Lino is based on) as authentically as possible.</p><p>Eugenio explained that he "felt responsible to carry the story on [his] shoulders," adding that he "put a lot of [himself] in the building of the character, brick by brick."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the same Tudum interview, Eugenio even clicked with Tembi's real-life daughter, Zoela, who she shared with Saro. Apparently, Zoela gave her seal of approval for the casting after meeting Eugenio, saying, "OK, yeah, he's everything I thought he would be. He's a nice guy. He's fun. He's all the things."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Eugenio have any other upcoming projects in the works?</h2><p>We may not have official confirmation if Eugenio is off the dating market, but what about upcoming acting projects?</p><p>According to Eugenio's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, he doesn't appear to have any other projects currently in the works. His most recent was the 2021 Italian miniseries La Fuggitiva, which ran for eight episodes. However, now that From Scratch has dropped on Netflix, we'd be shocked if he's not bombarded with acting offers soon!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Did you know that Eugenio is also a trained theater actor, and that he's fluent in three languages? (English, Italian, and Sicilian, just FYI).</p><p>Tembi was so impressed by Eugenio's audition for Lino, and his uncanny physical resemblance to Saro, that it seems like Eugenio was destined to play Lino from the start. "This is something I haven't told [the Lockes] before," Eugenio shared, "but I felt a connection [with Lino] when I read the script."</p><p>You can stream From Scratch now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsKosc2ipmalkajBs63NnamemV2stqex</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
