In 2005, they reunited when she appeared on his talk show and even took a Cosmopolitan compatibility quiz, scoring a 92 percent. “Can we just say that, for the time being, no matter what happened, I was a really good girlfriend to you and you were a great boyfriend?” Hewitt asked. He responded, “The latter part is so true. The first part is definitely true.”</p><p>In 2018, the Criminal Minds alum shared a <a href=#>throwback photo of the pair cozying up</a> on the VMAs carpet. “In honor of the VMA red carpet tonight. This was my VMA moment. Someone said that hair was cute. We are no longer friends lol,” she captioned the Instagram photo. “Wow that was a long time ago. #throwback #vmaredcarpet #iFeelOldAF.”</p><p>That wasn’t the only notable romance in Hewitt’s life. She made headlines in 2002 after being spotted holding hands with Mayer. At the time, rumors surfaced that his song, “Your Body Is a Wonderland” was about her, but the song actually came out before the pair began dating and he later said that he wrote the song about his first love.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 9-1-1 actor found The One years later, marrying her Client List costar <strong>Brian Hallisay</strong> in 2013.
