Rumors abounded that Sinatra was on his death bed, rumors that his wife Barbara fiercely disputed in April of 1998.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_33>“The rumors are just crazy. You can’t believe it. He’s doing very well. You’d think they’d just stop with it,” she told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas Sun</a>. “He’s strong and walking around.

Barbara said that it was just because he valued his private life.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_22>“He’s a very private man,” she explained. “He feels very strongly about his private life and his financial life being kept private.”</p><h2>The singer spoke his last words to his wife and close friend</h2><p id=par-6_33>Just a month after the interview with Barbara, Sinatra died of a heart attack. At the time of his death, Sinatra was with his close friend and manager Tony Oppedisano and wife Barbara.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_49>“His two doctors and a number of technicians were surrounding him when I walked in,” Oppedisano told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>. “I sat by him and held his hand, trying to keep him calm. Then his wife Barbara arrived and told him to fight. He struggled to speak because of his breathing.”</p><p id=par-8_11>At that point, Sinatra looked them and uttered his final words.</p><p id=par-9_14>“He just looked up at the two of us and said curtly: ‘I’m losing.’”</p><p id=par-10_11>Despite the grim proclamation, Oppedisano said that Sinatra didn’t seem upset.</p><p id=par-11_47>“He wasn’t panicked,” he said. “He was just resigned to the fact that he had given it his best but he wasn’t going to come through. I told him I loved him but those were the last words I ever heard him say before he passed away.”</p><h2>Frank Sinatra was buried with some surprising items</h2><p id=par-12_40>Sinatra was buried in Cathedral City, California, just outside of his beloved Palm Springs. His family shared that they placed&nbsp;<a href=#>several items in his coffin</a>: a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, a Zippo lighter, a pack of Camels, and 10 dimes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_14>Sinatra always had phone change on him after the 1963 <a href=#>kidnapping of his son</a>.</p><p id=par-14_35>“I think it came from Frankie’s kidnapping, maybe before,” his daughter Tina said on&nbsp;Larry King Live, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AP</a>. “He never wanted to get caught not able to make a phone call.
