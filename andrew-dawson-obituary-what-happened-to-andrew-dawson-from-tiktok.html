But what exactly happened with him after that? A significant number of people have mysteriously disappeared from social media platforms over the duration of their existence. There will always be a reason for people to abandon social media sites, regardless of how big of a social media star they are (like Gabbie Hanna or Jenna Marbles) or how small of a producer they are (like myself). This is true for both of them.</p><p>In the case of Andrew Dawson, a popular TikToker who had amassed a following of more than 56,000 users, his absence has resulted in a substantial number of requests from viewers. When Dawson uploaded a video to their website in May of 2022 showing a “giant” standing on the peak of a mountain in Canada, this is when the questions initially came up.</p><p>Dawson’s inquiry into the unidentified person led him to what he believes to be encounters with the CIA and the Canadian CSIS, as well as allegations that he was “stalked” after the post was published. Dawson’s investigation also led him to charges that he was “stalked” by someone after the article was published. He also wrote a post with the subject line “I’m scared,” in which he informed readers that it was possible that they would never see another post from him again after this one, and he warned them that this was the last post they would ever see from him.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrc2dqZ6vXZmuuL%2FOp2SompmpwqK%2B2GauoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq3Nnamer12Zrri%2Fzqdkn6qfonq1tcqtpqRn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
