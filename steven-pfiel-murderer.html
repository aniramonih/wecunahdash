On July 17, 1993, Palos Hills citizen Hillary Norskog’s ferociously punctured body was found in a Palos Township range, three days after she was last seen with Pfiel leaving a party.
Steven was caught and accused of the murder charge but was released when his parents placed the obligatory 100,000 million dollars of a 1 million dollar bond."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He killed his own brother by slashing his throat and beating him with a bat.</p><p>On July 17, 1993, Palos Hills citizen Hillary Norskog’s ferociously punctured body was found in a Palos Township range, three days after she was last seen with Pfiel leaving a party.</p><p>Steven was caught and accused of the murder charge but was released when his parents placed the obligatory 100,000 million dollars of a 1 million dollar bond.</p><p>Later the Pfiel family relocated from Palos Park to Crete Township, where Steven again alleged to have murdered his 19-year-old brother, Roger, by slashing his throat with a meat cleaver and beating him with a baseball bat.</p><p>Before running away from the house and turning himself in later that day, He left a note for his parents, who were out for the night. <strong>“I now know I am guilty of two murders.”</strong></p><p>Defense and prosecution attorneys announced in Will County Circuit Court that Steven Pfiel pleaded responsible to both killings in trade for Will County not trailing the death penalty in Roger’s murder.</p><p>Steven was not eligible for the death penalty in the Hillary case because he was not 18 at the time of the crime.</p><p>Steven’s mother, Gayle Pfiel, made her very first courtroom appearance after her oldest son, Roger, was murdered.</p><p>Gayle’s eyes were red, and she choked back tears when Steven Pfiel murderer of his own brother was escorted into the room.</p><p>After the plea agreement terms, Pfiel’s attorney, Raymond Pijon, asked Pfiel some questions to determine whether he understood the consequences of his plea.&nbsp;</p><p>Pfiel’s responses were short, <strong>“Yes, sir.”</strong></p><p>Cook County Assistant State’s Atty. Ed Snow read the state’s evidence synopsis, which explained how Hillary’s body had been found decomposed with at least twelve stab damage <strong>“primarily in the head, neck and facial area.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The summary also recounted how investigators had recovered a hunting knife and a blood-soaked T-shirt from Steven’s room.</p><p>DNA tests on those samples matched Hillary’s blood.</p><p>Snow completed his statement by reporting a discovery that Hillary’s voice box and trachea had been sliced.</p><p>By that time, Marsha Norskog was slumped over and crying. She shifted from mourning Hillary to thrashing out at Steven and his parents.</p><p>She asked, <strong>“What made you think you could get away with murdering Hillary?”</strong> staring down Steven, <strong>“Is it because you have never been taught to be responsible for your actions? You have had everything handed to you.”</strong></p><p>As Norskog returned to her seat, she passed Gayle Pfiel and harshly whispered, <strong>“You knew. You knew.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Pijon stood to defend Steven’s parents, saying he sympathized with Marsha Norskog for her loss but not for trying to get money from the Pfiels in her civil suit.</p><p>He noted that <strong>“the stones you throw may come back in another direction.”</strong></p><p>Norskog, surrounded by her two children and a crowd of supporters exchanging hugs outside the court building, said she thought Pfiel showed his true colors by not making any statement.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2F056tnqZdpbOqsctmpK6qlJq%2Fpr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
