The best friends, who were both just ten years old, were attending a barbeque at Jessica's house when they decided to leave without telling anybody to buy sweets from a vending machine at the local sports centre.<strong> Sadly, though they never returned as on their route back to Jessica's house, they crossed paths with their killer Ian Huntley.</strong></p><p id=ez_22z8qJGdr data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="7 best crime documentaries on Netflix that are a must-watch" class=hm-link href=#>7 best crime documentaries on Netflix that are a must-watch</a></strong></p><p id=e-gHhgtt9Cvp data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="This Netflix true crime series is making a comeback - but fans all have the same complaint" class=hm-link href=#>This Netflix true crime series is making a comeback - but fans all have the same complaint</a></strong></p><p id=ep1oZresToNd data-wc=56>Huntley worked as a caretaker at the girls' school and was also dating one of their teaching assistants, meaning that he was a familiar face to the girls<strong>.
