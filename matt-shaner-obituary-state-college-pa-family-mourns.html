Until the 22nd of December in 2023, November 24, 1979 Located in Pennsylvania, Sewickley An unexpected death occurred in Key Largo, Florida, involving Mathias “Matt” Shaner, who was 44 years old and from Sewickley, Pennsylvania. The unexpected passing of this man has left his loved ones, friends, and coworkers in utter disbelief.</p><p>Larger than life, Matt was cherished by a huge number of people and will be sorely missed by everyone. On November 24, 1979, Matt Shaner was born to his parents, Ellen and Lance Shaner, in Bolivar, New York. Matt had a wonderful upbringing in Bolivar, where he was the oldest of three children, precocious, and a natural leader. He organized outdoor activities with his brothers, relatives, and people from the area. When Matt was 13 years old, his family relocated to State College, Pennsylvania.</p><p>While there, he attended State College High School, worked a variety of jobs, and joined the State College High School football team. After that, Matt went on to study history at Pennsylvania State University after attending Kiski Prep, which is located in Pennsylvania. During his time as a student at Penn State, Matt became a member of Phi Kappa Tau and, in the year 2000, in collaboration with his fraternity brothers, he established the youth charity soccer competition known as Kicks-4-Kids.</p><p>Matt worked for Senator Rick Santorum in Washington, District of Columbia, after he graduated from Penn State. During his time there, he established a number of personal and professional connections. Subsequently, he went back to State College to work for the family business, which is where he met his wife, Andrea. As part of his efforts to pursue his passion for politics, Matt served as the Pennsylvania Chairman for President Bush’s re-election campaign in 2004. He also played a constructive role in the election of Senator Patrick Toomey and mounted two personal campaigns in bids for the offices of State Representative and United States Congress.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwucCtq2armJa7pr6MqJmirKWWv7p50q2YrZ1dmLytuMSgnGaokWKzornIpbBmpZ%2Bqv6%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
