This new role would come to define his entire career. He had previously sent audition tapes to "SNL" numerous times, and each time the producers rejected him, claiming that he was too young. For the first two years, Thompson was a featured player. In 2004, Kenan Thompson released a comedy album called "Good Times."</p><p>In 2005, he was promoted to repertory player. He has remained a central part of the series for well over 18 seasons, and he is now the most senior cast member. Thompson is famous for portraying a number of celebrities, and he is quite talented in terms of impressions. However, he refused to do any more impressions of black women in 2018, citing the need for "SNL" to hire more women of color.</p><p>Many observers and critics have commented on Thompson's importance in the "SNL" cast. He is particularly praised for his ability to react comedically to various situations. Head writer Brian H. Tucker noted that in order to make a skit funny, all he needs to do is write the words "Kenan Reacts" into the script. Various critics have stated that Thompson is the person that the rest of the cast "relies on" to successfully get laughs. One media source referred to Kenan as the "glue" that holds the "SNL" cast together.</p><p>There are 21 episodes in a season. First-year cast members make $7,000 per episode, which equates to about $147,000 per season. Second-year cast members make $8,000 per episode, which equates to about $168,000 per season. If a cast member makes it to their fifth season, they make $15,000 per episode. This equates to $315,000 per season.</p><p>Those who have been with SNL for three years longer earn the highest salaries, as these individuals are considered to be crucial to the success of the show. These veteran comedians earn $25,000 per episode, which equates to $525,000 per year. Kenan has been on the show since 2003, which is a longer run than any other actor in history. Because of this, his salary is almost certainly above and beyond the standard amounts we've already listed. We believe that Thompson's SNL salary is likely $2-3 million per year.
