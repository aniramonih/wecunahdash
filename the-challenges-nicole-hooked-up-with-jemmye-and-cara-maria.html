Nicole and Challenge vet <strong>Laurel Stucky</strong> ended their relationship before The Challenge: Vendettas, so she was blindsided when Laurel showed up as a mercenary midway through the show. During the Tuesday, April 10, reunion special, Nicole addressed the split … and what happened next.</p><p>“We broke up based on the distance. She’s just on a different page than I am at this time,” Nicole explained. “She knew what I did. It wasn’t a secret. The one hookup that I’m not proud about is with <strong>Cara [Maria Sorbello]</strong>. I didn’t intentionally want to hurt her.”</p><p>Cara Maria and Laurel were best friends before Nicole was introduced on The Challenge: Invasion of the Champions. During that season, Nicole had a crush on Cara, who was not interested. When Cara denied her, Nicole grew closer to Laurel. Cara and Laurel’s friendship ended shortly after.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/laurel-nicole-the-challenge-vendettas.jpg><p>However, the kiss between Cara and Nicole was shown on the show — what wasn’t shown was the other person Nicole was hooking up with.</p><p>“Me and Laurel broke up before the show. Laurel didn’t know that I was going on it. She found out it the day that I was leaving. You could say that I went on single and I did exactly me,” Nicole explained. “I’m not ashamed about it. I don’t care. The one thing that I do want to kind of get out there is that I didn’t intentionally want to hurt Laurel.”</p><p>As for how she felt when Laurel walked into the game as a mercenary, Nicole admitted, “The feelings came back fast, but at the same time, I can’t really say much when I was hooking up with <strong>Jemmye [Carroll]</strong>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now that was not shown during the show. Jemmye didn’t look surprised, just smiling in the sneak peek, while Cory actually stood up and screamed he was so shocked.</p><p>Part 1 of The Challenge: Vendettas reunion airs on MTV Tuesday, April 10, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2YtaK4y56loJ2jYruqr86lnGagn6S4prCMrqdmr5mptW62xKaksp1dlrulecKaqZplnZa%2Fqq2O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
