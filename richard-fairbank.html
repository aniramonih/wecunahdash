Mr. Fairbank came up with the idea that would become Capital One’s defining feature – the Information-Based Strategy (IBS).</p><p>IBS was introduced by Richard Fairbank and Nigel Morris by combining the previously distinct departments of marketing, credit, risk operations, and information technology into a single flexible decision-making framework that allows Capital One to personalize financial services to each customer’s specific needs.</p><p>Under Mr. Fairbank’s leadership, Capital One’s client base has grown to an amazing 47.2 million people, with $75.5 billion in managed loans. Internationally, the company has expanded into countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. Fairbank began his financial services career in 1985 as a partner at Strategic Planning Associates (now Mercer Management Consulting), where he developed the banking division.</p><p>During this moment, the seeds of IBS were sown. Mr. Fairbank believed that credit card companies were passing up an opportunity to combine the critical consumer feedback provided by direct response marketing with the power of information technology to create a scientific strategy for addressing client desires.</p><p>His goal was to create a rigorous “test-and-learn” system for giving the correct items to customers with all forms of credit at the right time and at the right price. Richard Fairbank then enlisted the help of Morris, another Strategic Planning Associates expert, to flesh out this notion and find a significant credit card issuer keen to execute this unique, science-based marketing method.</p><p>Signet Bank in Richmond was the first to see the potential of this unique concept, and Mr. Fairbank and Mr. Morris joined Signet in 1988 to start Capital One.</p><p>After a few years and hundreds of tests, Fairbank broke the code to build unique products that met their tight risk requirements, and in 1991, he pioneered the “balance transfer” credit card product, which altered the business’s competitive landscape. In 1995, Signet’s credit card segment was separated.</p><h2><span id=Achievements_Awards>Achievements & Awards</span></h2><ul><li>Following the success of establishing a very powerful firm, Richard Fairbank has had various accomplishments, with this being one of his significant accomplishments.</li><li>In addition, he has received various accolades, including the Washingtonian Business Leader of the Year award, as well as being named to the lists of the top 10 CEOs and the 50 Best CEOs.</li></ul><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Richard Fairbank’s <strong>height</strong> is 6 feet 1 inch and he <strong>weighs</strong> 74 kg.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a href=#>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a href=#>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Businessman</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Nadim Kassar</a></h3>Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Nadim Kassar's Estimated Net Worth, Age, Biography, Career, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki.
