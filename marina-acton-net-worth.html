Marina Acton reportedly graduated from Stanford and George Washington University Law School. Acton was a formal legal assistant for Ukraine's Prosecutor General. She has also been an intern for the federal courts in Washington, D.C. She went to acting school and started a singing career with the single "Fantasize". Acton now lives in Los Angeles, California and would like the world to believe that she is very good friends with <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>. Well, the two are sort of friends. When Marina purchased Kim Kardashian's home in Bel Air for $17.8 million she reportedly included an agreement in the purchase contract that made Kim pretend to be her friend in several social media posts. The property is located in a gated community called Bel Air Crest. Kim purchased the house on her own in 2013 for $9 million. Kim and Kanye then spent several million dollars on various upgrades. Marina's goals was to buy the mansion to jump start a pop career. Unfortunately that career fizzled, as did the mansion. Remember, she bought Kimye's house in 2017 for $17.8 million. Property records show that Marina Acton and her husband attempted to flip it shortly after moving in for a shade over $18 million. They ultimately had to settle for $14 million in 2018. A $3.8 million loss in a little less than a year not including closing costs and various other real estate transaction fees.</p><p>Connection to Whatsapp founder? Contrary to popular online rumor, Marina Acton's wealth is NOT connected to WhatsApp co-founder <a href=#>Brian Acton</a>. Despite sharing the same last name, Brian and Marina Acton are not married and have never been married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyurdGipZplkZjBsLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
