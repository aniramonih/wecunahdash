Ethnicity And Net Worth Details</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-08</div><p><strong>Kim Petras</strong> is the first openly transgender Grammy winner. She appreciates and thanks her supportive parents. The Heart to Break singer remarked that she would not have been able to pursue and achieve in her music profession without the support of her mother and father. Petras, who is open about her problems and difficulties as a trans artist, has drawn significant media attention not just to herself, but also to her family history and ethnic origin. Let’s go into the specifics.</p><h2>Kim Petras’ Parents</h2><p><strong>The 2023 Queerty Award-winning singer</strong> was born in Bonn, Germany, to German parents Lutz and Kornelia Konni Petras. Her father is an architect who works at Landmark Real Estate’s planning section, and her mother is a dance choreographer and artist.</p><h2>Kim Petras Has A Sibling</h2><p>Kim, who used to go by the name Tim Petras before having transsexual surgery, is the youngest of her parents’ two children. She has an older sister, Sina Petras, who enjoys music as well.&nbsp;Sina began her career by playing guitar during her younger sister’s shows. She used to share films of her sister and her participation on MySpace and YouTube.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kim-Petras-1.jpg alt="Kim Petras" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Her Transgender Identity Was Always Accepted by Her Supportive Parents</h2><p>Kim Petras’ parents, Lutz and Konni, are the reason she stands proudly on stage and motivates young people who are hiding in the closet. Petras, who was born a biological boy, was already coming to grips with her sexual identity at the age of two, and her parents were aware of it. She began visiting psychiatrists by the age of ten, and professionals verified to her parents that she was transsexual. Petras was able to begin hormone replacement treatment at the age of 12. She had surgery in November 2008, at the age of 16, becoming the youngest transgender person to transition.</p><p>According to reports, her father and mother had transsexual acquaintances, so they were aware of the concept and how it needed to be handled. Their support, facilitation, and inspiration were critical in Kim recognizing and embracing her gender identity.</p><h2>Kim Admitted to Being A Suicidal Kid’ as a Child</h2><p>She took care to divulge information about her life that many admirers were previously unaware of in a 2023 interview with Out Magazine. The New Princess of Pop started by revealing that she “was very suicidal as a kid” and that she would not be where she is now if her parents had not believed in her abilities. That drive prompted her to honor her parents at the 2023 Grammy Awards when she became the first openly transgender person to win a Grammy in the ‘best pop group/duo performance category.’ She shared the prize with English singer Sam Smith for their collaborative hit “Unholy.”</p><h2>Petras’ Grandparents Were Resistant to Her Transition</h2><p>Kim discussed her early years after coming out as trans in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music, which was broadcast on YouTube on July 10, 2022. Her grandparents were displeased and begged her to alter her mind.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kim-Petras-2.jpg alt="Kim Petras" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When her grandparents persuaded her to see a psychiatrist to alter her views, she refused and forced them to accept it. She was already focused on what she wanted. Kim remembered her grandparents stating, even after she transitioned as a teenager, “Well, that’s great that you found out what you’re going to do, but you’re going to hell now.”</p><h2>What Ethnicity Is Kim?</h2><p>Kim Petras was raised in a German household and is of German origin. She has embraced her cultural heritage and infused it into her artistic personality. Her German ancestry and creative ambitions mix in her music, giving her a unique and influential character in the music business.</p><h2>Is She Religious?</h2><p>Kim has spoken about her spiritual experiences and views, despite the fact that she has not completely acknowledged her religious beliefs. It does not, however, indicate whether she is a Christian. Rather, she has indicated that her connection with religion is fabricated rather than founded on real religious views.</p><h2>Kim Petra’s Net worth</h2><p>Petras’ net worth is projected to be over $4 million as of 2023. Her monthly salary is $45,000, which amounts to $500K per year, according to web sources. Her singing career, endorsement partnerships, and other commercial ventures have all contributed to her riches.&nbsp;She earns money not just by selling records but also by playing live, endorsing companies, and utilizing different social media platforms and music streaming services like Spotify.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqVdpbK1vsCsZLChm556uLTOZpirnV2dsrN5z5qpnqakqHqmwMenoJyhpK56orrDZqWerF2svLPAx2abnqyRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
