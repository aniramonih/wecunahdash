Olly Alexander is ‘really’ in love
 The Years and Years star previously revealed he has a “paramour” and though he wouldn’t name his partner, he revealed he had known him for years before they got together romantically.
 The ‘It’s A Sin’ actor – who was previously in a relationship with former Clean Bandit star Neil Milan – gushed that he’s never felt love like this before."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I feel like this is a new feeling for me as well, even though I’m with someone who, we were together quite a long time ago, but now we’re kind of in a sequel.</p><p>“This one has turned out to be really, really good. It’s also a bit of a pandemic rekindle.”</p><p>The 31-year-old singer-and-actor loves having someone to “lean on” after years of being single.</p><p>Speaking on ‘Charli XCX’s Best Song Ever’ podcast, he spilled: “I haven’t been in one place for so long, so just having this experience with someone I really love and being able to lean on someone has been amazing.</p><p>“I was single for quite a while.”</p><p>Olly feeling secure with his partner comes after he admitted he finds it harder to “trust” people because it’s difficult for him to have any sort of anonymity – while he also struggled to form intimate relationships.</p><p>Discussing the inspiration behind the songs on his most recent album, ‘Night Call’, he said: “I was lacking a lot of things in my life like fun and connections with strangers, sex, intimacy in general.</p><p>“[The songs talk about how] a hook-up could be the most transcendent, beautiful experience. I felt like it was just something that I couldn’t experience any more in my life for different reasons. Trusting people became harder . . . there are definitely places in the world where I’m anonymous, but it can feel like that’s sort of taken away from you.</p><p>“It was almost getting into character and saying things that I would never have said in real life. Just pushing this more confident part of my personality.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOqKOlsV2WuabEwKebnqpdnsBuv8yiq62dnmLEqsDHZp%2Biq12ixrTAxKuwZqWRo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
