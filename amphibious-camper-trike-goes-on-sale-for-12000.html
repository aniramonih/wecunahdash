to upgrade cycle touring, I came up with the idea of a vehicle that combines a tricycle, a small boat and camper.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He formed a team of engineers and ‘makers’ to develop a new version of the Triton, made using 3D printing and built out of fibreglass moulds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It takes about five minutes to switch between land and water mode, according to the firm, involving moving the bicycle part upwards into the cabin.
