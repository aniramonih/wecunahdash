She is the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, which contains most of Atlanta. She is the first woman to hold the office.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Willis was born in Inglewood, California. Her father was a member of the Black Panthers and a criminal defense attorney.</p><p>Willis studied political science at Howard University, graduating with honors in 1993, and later attended Emory University School of Law, graduating in 1996 with a Juris Doctor. She spent 16 years as a prosecutor in the Fulton County district attorney’s office. Her most prominent case was her prosecution of the Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal.</p><p>In 2018, she went into private practice. That year, she ran for a seat on the Fulton County Superior Court and lost. In 2019, Willis became the chief municipal judge for South Fulton, Georgia.</p><p>In 2020, Willis was elected district attorney for Fulton County, defeating Paul Howard Jr., a six-term incumbent and her former boss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2020-election-and-investigation><strong>2020 Election and Investigation</strong></h2><p>On February 10, 2021, Willis launched a criminal investigation into Donald Trump’s attempts to influence Georgia election officials—including the governor, the attorney general, and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger via a telephone call—to “find” enough votes to override Joe Biden’s win in that state and thus undo Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In January 2022, she requested a special grand jury to consider charges of election interference by Trump and his allies. In May, a 26-member special grand jury was given investigative authority and subpoena power and tasked with submitting a report to the judge and Willis on whether a crime was committed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Willis sent target letters to people she is investigating related to the fake election plot. These include two Republican officials — State Senator Brandon Beach and David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party— and the 16 people who falsely presented themselves as electors. She also sent a target letter to State Senator Burt Jones, but then a judge said she could not target Jones due to a conflict of interest.</p><p>After hearing from 75 witnesses—including former US Sen. Kelly Loeffler, former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, and possibly Sidney Powell—the special grand jury completed its work and was dissolved on January 9, 2023. On February 16, following a judge’s order, parts of the report were released.</p><p>The judge did not permit the release of recommendations for possible charges, intending to preserve the “due process” for anyone who might be indicted later. Several days later, the foreperson of the grand jury hinted that the recommendations were not “some giant plot twist” and that no one would be “surprised”.</p><p>A different grand jury has yet to decide on charges.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On April 24, 2023, Willis announced she would announce decisions to charge Trump and his associates during the Georgia Superior Courts’ fourth term, perhaps as soon as July or August 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-old-is-fani-willis><strong>How old is Fani Willis?</strong></h2><p>Fani Willis was born in 1971, but the exact date and month are not known, so her age might be either 51 or 52.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCywKegZq%2BZobmqv4ywoKShoJqxqq2MmqWdZZGcsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
