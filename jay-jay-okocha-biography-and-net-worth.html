I mean it was amazing!”</p><p>In 1990, he joined Enugu Rangers. While he was with the club he exhibited many spectacular displays including one where he rounded off and scored a goal, against experienced Nigerian goalkeeper William Okpara in a match against BCC Lions.</p><p>His breakthrough into professional football came when he went on holiday to West Germany in 1990, to watch the German league football.

This was voted goal of the year by German TV viewers.</p><p>After Eintracht Frankfurt was relegated into second Bundesliga in 1996, Okocha transferred to Turkish first division club Fenerbahce during which he took the Turkish citizenship as Muhammet Yavuz.</p><p>In 2002, Jay Jay Okocha made the switch to Premier League club Bolton Wanderers, where he managed 124 appearances and 14 goals. He was voted BBC African player of the year in 2003 and 2004.</p><p>When Bolton decided not to extend the Nigerian’s contract in 2006, he spent a year in Qatar before signing a one year contract with the Championship Club Hull City for the 2007/08 season, with whom he achieved promotion into the Premier League.</p><p>In 1994, 1998, and 2002, he participated at the World Cup for the Nigerian national football team-the Super Eagles. In 1994 and 1998, the team got to the knock out stages.</p><p>His biggest international successes with the Nigerian National team include winning the Africa Cup of Nations in 1994 and the Olympic gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996.</p><p>At the Africa Cup of Nations in 2004, Jay Jay Okocha led the Super Eagles to third place and was also voted the best player of the tournament.
