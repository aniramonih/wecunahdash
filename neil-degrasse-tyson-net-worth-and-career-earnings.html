He then went on to work for A-list organizations like the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City and got into the movies, TV series, radio and TV hosting, podcasting, and more.</p><h2><strong>How Much Money Did Neil deGrasse Tyson Make?</strong></h2><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson has made a fortune through his multi-faceted career. At the last check, his net worth was pegged at a tidy $5 million. His fortune accrued from an annual remuneration of $500k, which has been appreciating as the years rolled by.</p><h2><strong>Major Sources of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson’s Net Worth and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Income</strong></h2><p>Neil earns his keep from diverse sources. He is a certified astrophysicist, an accomplished author, a celebrated science communicator, a respected lecturer, and an acclaimed actor.</p><p>Apart from the aforementioned, the astrophysicist has worked in different prestigious organizations where he held exulted positions. He has also handled a lot of governmental jobs through special appointments. His social media handles have proved to be quite successful, with millions of followers, and that is another major income source for Neil.</p><h3><strong>Neil Started Earning Income from an Early Stage</strong></h3><p>Right from his formative years, Neil deGrasse Tyson was already displaying interest in astronomy, and by the time he attained 15 years of age, the American scientist was already knowledgeable in the field. Thus, he started giving astronomy lectures. Needless to say, he was earning some change from his early teaching efforts, though it was not much.</p><p>When the time came for Neil to proceed with higher academic qualifications, he chose to join Harvard against the advice of famed astronomer Carl Sagan who did his best to convince the then-teenager to attend Cornell University.</p><p>In 1980, he graduated from Harvard with a degree in physics and proceeded to the University of Texas at Austin; he completed his master’s in astronomy in 1983. Following this, Neil rekindled his lecturing career, and his services were employed by the University of Maryland in 1986, a position he maintained for the ensuing year; Neil left his lecturing job in 1987.</p><p>One year later, in 1988, Neil deGrasse Tyson got into Columbia University to complete his astronomy graduate program, graduating with MPhil in 1989; his major was astrophysics.</p><p>At this point in his career life, the astronaut was already associated with NASA and ARCS, and through their foundation, he was able to secure enough funds for his doctoral thesis while completing his Ph.D. Professor R. Michael Rich played a huge role in securing the funds for Neil.</p><p>With the funding he got, the doctoral student was able to attend important international meetings in different parts of the world, including Europe, South Africa, and South America. The money he got also made it possible for Neil to hire the services of students who did an extensive job for him on data reduction.</p><p>By the time he completed his Ph.D. studies in astrophysics in 1991, Neil deGrasse Tyson acquired a great understanding of Type 1a Supernovas, leading to the enhanced measurement accuracy of what is referred to as the Hubble constant as well as dark matter.</p><p>With his academic journey done and dusted, the Astrologist continued earning his keep as a professor and researcher at several other universities, including Princeton University. He quickly gained recognition for his achievement in astrophysics. Neil is gifted with an unusual ability to understand and explain complex scientific concepts in a manner that will be comprehensible to a general audience.</p><p>Even after he attained the height of his career as an astronaut, the Harvard alum still engages in research. He is currently with the American Museum of Natural History’s Department of Physics as one of their research associates.</p><h3><strong>He is best known as an Astrophysicist</strong></h3><p>From the education field, Neil deGrasse Tyson went on to launch a professional career as an astrophysicist. Luck smiled on the scientist when the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City hired his services to work at Hayden Planetarium. Neil started with the organization in 1994 in his capacity as a staff scientist and rose through the ranks very fast.</p><p>He was barely one year at Hayden Planetarium when his status was elevated to the rank of acting Director in 1995. Neil’s good luck streak continued in 1996 as the Harvard alum was finally pronounced the director of the Hayden Planetarium.</p><p>During Neil’s tenure as a director, he took charge of overseeing the organization’s $210 million dollar reconstruction project. He did excellent work with the project, which came to a conclusion in 2000.</p><p>It is worthy of note that the Rose Center for Earth and Space is connected to the American Museum of Natural History, where Neil functions as a research associate and established its Department of Astrophysics, which came into existence in 1997.</p><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson is currently rated the fifth head of the renowned Hayden Planetarium in New York. He is equally the initial occupant of its Frederick P. Rose Directorship.</p><p>The globally famous astronaut is also associated with the Planetary Society, where he has served in different capacities as the president, vice president, and board chairman. All these positions are high-end jobs that rake in handsome remunerations, and it is not surprising that they are credited for contributing a huge portion of Neil’s bank balance.</p><h3><strong>Neil Also Makes Money as a TV Host</strong></h3><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson kick-started his career on television as a host in 2004 when he hosted Origins – PBS Nova’s four-part series. In 2009, he also was back on PBS narrating the documentary entitled 400 Years of the Telescope. He has worked with the History Channel, regularly appearing on the set of its popular series, “The Universe.”</p><p>Between 2006 to 2011, Neil hosted the NOVA ScienceNow – a popular documentary on TV. In 2014, National Geography Channel turned the show into a late-night talk show.</p><p>Neil recorded a lot of keynote speaker appearances, including his presence at occasions and events like film festivals. He was later mandated to resurrect The Cosmos: A Personal Voyage – a defunct iconic series previously hosted by Carl Sagan. He completed the job in 2014 when the groundbreaking series entitled, “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” finally hit the airwaves.</p><p>The program was quite interesting, airing on both National Geographical Channel and Fox. After hosting the first season, which comprised 13 episodes, Neil deGrasse Tyson said he may not be opportune to host season two. However, he returned on the 9th of March 2020 to host the follow-up season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds.</p><p>His weekly podcast called StarTalk, which evolved into a radio show, also became a late-night show on National Geographic Channel. On the set of the show, which took off on the 20th of April 2015, we saw Neil interviewing A-list pop culture celebs on issues like science and their individual life experiences.</p><h3><strong>Movies and TV Series Also Contribute to&nbsp;</strong><strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson’s Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Neil deGrasse Tyson is one American scientist that is blessed with versatility.
