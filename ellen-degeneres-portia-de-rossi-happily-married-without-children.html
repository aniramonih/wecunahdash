Portia described her life as Ellen’s wife a few months ago, <a href=#>talking about the contentment she felt, and even talking about how Ellen’s mom calls Portia her “daughter-in-law”. </a>Now it’s Ellen’s turn to talk about marriage… and babies. In a new interview with AOL Television (story via People), Ellen talks up marriage, but seems to definitively rule out becoming a parent. She says that she and Portia have talked about it, and they have decided they like their life as-is, with their animals and their niece:</p><p>Don’t expect Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi to become moms anytime soon.</p><p>Although the couple told PEOPLE last August that they talk about having kids, they have decided that they are happier being cool aunts.</p><p>“I don’t think we’re going to have kids,” DeGeneres tells AOL Television. “We have animals, and we love them. And, you know, we are brand new aunts. Her brother and his wife just had a baby girl who’s a month old now, and it’s fun to be a part of that.”</p><p>After tying the knot last summer, DeGeneres told PEOPLE, “It’s something we would never take lightly and just say, ‘That would be fun.’ It’s a lot of work and we recognize that. In a way, we want to be selfish because we love our life, but we know how much that adds to it.”</p><p>DeGeneres, 51, and de Rossi, 36, who have crusading for gay marriage, have since decided to focus on their relationship rather than have children. “It’s just a huge responsibility, and I don’t know that that’s something we want to take on,” DeGeneres says. “We’re very happily married without children.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>People</a>]</p><p>I totally respect Ellen or anyone else who comes right out and says that they don’t feel the need to be a parent. <a href=#>Cameron Diaz said something like this recently</a>, and <a href=#>Sandra Bullock also spoke out about how she didn’t feel the need to have biological children</a>. All too often, I think society subtly or not-so-subtly “punishes” women who have made the decision not to become mothers. That being said, I really wonder if Portia really feels the same way as Ellen. Portia is fifteen years younger than Ellen, and her biological clock might be on a different wavelength. I really hope Portia isn’t saying “no” to kids just because Ellen isn’t interested… but maybe I’m reading too much into it. Perhaps after Portia gave motherhood deeper consideration, she just decided she prefers the fur-babies too.</p><p>Ellen and Portia are shown out on 4/18/09.
