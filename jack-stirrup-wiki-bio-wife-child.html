Little is known about Jack’s early life and the man is in no hurry to change it. Before making out as a yachtie, Jack worked as an engineer in the Merchant Navy. On the deck, Jack often joked about his life on the navy and shared his shenanigans. In one of the episodes, Jack revealed about a time when he shaved one of his legs to imagine that a woman was sitting beside him.<br>During his time in the Merchant Navy, Jack spent most of his time in the French Riviera at bars. As a result, he lost a ton of money and had to look for work in a boat. This eventually brought jack into yachting and Below deck.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yachting</h2><p>Even though Jack was working here and there, things were not exactly on the rise. Things changed for him when he was brought on the fourth season of the TV series, Below Deck Mediterranean. Even though he hated working and avoided work at all costs, he got things done when he had to. A free-spirited guy, Jack was often reminded by his fellow cast members to wear shoes while leaving the boat. This often led to hilarious situations during the team’s outing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship on board</h2><p>The ever comic character, Jack was perfect for the fun-loving second stew, Aesha. The pair enjoyed flirtatious moments on board and were all but set for a potential relationship. However, things were never meant to be for the pair. In particular, Aesha was irked by Jack’s comments to Hannah during a group dinner.<br>Hannah who seemed to be feeling under the weather seemed upset during the dinner, to which Jack commented,<br>“why is your face, looks like you’ve just been raped?”</p><p>Aesha called Jack out on the comment but Jack denied ever saying so. But when Aesha opened up about being the survivor of sexual assault, Jack was quick to apologize. In an interview with Bravo TV, Jack commented on the episode.</p><p>“Just thinking about the fact that I had joked about something could have brought that person back to that situation and made them think about that horrible situation”.</p><p>Aesha looked over the whole situation and forgave Jack.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After Below Deck</h2><p>Despite his difficulties, Jack managed to finish the season and left the yacht with Aesha. He invited her to come to London and meet his family, but he also had a secret. He was still in love with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Hidge, who he had dated before joining the show. He decided to break up with Aesha and go back to Kelly, leaving Aesha heartbroken and confused.</p><p>Jack and Kelly soon had some happy news. They were expecting their first child together, a son named Phoenix Sidney Stirrup. Jack announced the birth of his baby boy on social media in April 2020. He expressed his love and gratitude for his son and his girlfriend.</p><p>He has not revealed what he is doing for work now, but he may have left the yachting industry for good. He may have returned to his previous career as a Merchant Navy engineer or pursued something else entirely. In the meantime, Jack’s relationship status with Kelly is also unclear as of now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Jack’s net worth and sources of income are not publicly known, but he may have earned some money from his appearance on Below Deck Mediterranean season 4. He worked as a deckhand on the Sirocco yacht. He may have also made some income from his previous career as a Merchant Navy engineer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Physical trait</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=5><tr readability=2><td>Height</td><td>5 feet 7 inches (approx.)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair style</td><td>Curly and long</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Grey</td></tr><tr><td>Skin tone</td><td>Tan</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Facial features</td><td>Oval face, thin eyebrows, straight nose, full lips, stubble beard</td></tr><tr><td>Body type</td><td>Slim and fit</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Tattoo</td><td>A portrait of his ex-girlfriend Katie Flood on his right arm</td></tr><tr><td>Clothing style</td><td>Casual and colorful</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Stirrup FAQs</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tbody readability=18><tr readability=2><td>Is Jack Stirrup still on Below Deck Mediterranean?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is Jack Stirrup married?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have a son?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Jack Stirrup still with Kelly Hidge?</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup cheat on Aesha Scott?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have a tattoo of Katie Flood?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Jack Stirrup from Liverpool?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Was Jack Stirrup an engineer in the Merchant Navy?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup clash with Joao Franco on the yacht?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup delete his Instagram account?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have a net worth of $1 million?</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup win any awards for his work on Below Deck Mediterranean?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have a brother named Tom?</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup fly BAC Strikemasters in the Dhofar War?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup hate yachting and want to quit?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have curly hair?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup invite Aesha Scott to London to meet his family?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Does Jack Stirrup have a zodiac sign of Sagittarius?</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Jack Stirrup express his love for his son on social media?</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGihmpubYsC1tdGrrKllp564qnnBoqZmr5mbsm6vx6KjnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
