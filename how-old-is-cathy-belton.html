In 2012, she spoke of her father with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Irish Examiner</a>, where she shared what her father used to tell her when she was younger.</p><p>He always told her to treat people how she would want to be treated, and now, it is the best advice she has ever gotten for her.</p><p>She thinks that it is so essential, particularly in her line of profession.
