Fans still want to know: Is Anna Faris engaged?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>Are there wedding bells in store for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris</a>? It's what tons of fans are asking since recent photos of the 42-year-old actress have surfaced. She stepped out in casual wear and a baseball cap while running her errands in Los Angeles, but it was tough to ignore the shiny new rock that was on her left hand. Does this mean that Anna is now engaged? And if so, to whom?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Anna seeing?</h2><p>She’s now in a relationship with cinematographer Michael Barrett. They started dating in November 2017, a few months after Anna announced her split from her ex-husband, <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>. The actress met Michael while they were working together on her film,&nbsp;Overboard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Early in 2018, a friend of Anna's revealed that she and Michael were perfect together. They <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “They are a great match. All of her friends love him. He’s so down-to-earth, stable and obsessed with Anna.”&nbsp;</p><p>They also noted Michael's awesome relationship with Anna's son, Jack: “Michael is great with him and that’s all Anna cares about. They are doing so well.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even Anna's Mom co-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison Janney</a>, shared her approval of the couple. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “She just seems great. She’s doing really well and I’m so happy for her. I met [Michael] once, he seems really lovely. I don’t know him, but I’m happy for her. If she’s happy, I’m happy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Anna Faris engaged to Michael Barrett?</h2><p>Most likely. Though the Scary Movie actress looked very engaged with her new diamond ring on her wedding finger, neither she nor her reps have confirmed anything or commented on the photos. However, it's possible that the two got secretly engaged and prefer to keep the details private.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Would this be Anna's second marriage?</h2><p>We all know that the actress was once married to Chris Pratt, with whom she has a 7-year-old son. The two first met in 2007, on the set of Take Me Home Tonight, and started dating shortly after. They got married in 2009, but by 2017, the couple separated and filed for divorce (to the disappointment of several fans).</p><p>However, this wasn't her first marriage. Before Chris, Anna was married to actor Ben Indra for three years. They met on the set of the 1999 indie film Lovers Lane and tied the knot in 2004, but filed for divorce in 2007.</p><p>If it's true that Anna is now engaged, this would be her third marriage.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Didn't Anna speak out against marriage after splitting up with Chris?</h2><p>When she was asked if she'd consider marriage again on the Divorce Sucks! podcast with Laura Wasser, she didn't exactly say "no," but she did explain that she had some issues with the institution of marriage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "I will say I believe in love and monogamy and I believe in the commitment with a relationship. But I do struggle, having gone through it a couple of times now, Laura, with the idea of our legal system. I struggle with that on kind of a feminist level."</p><p>In an interview with Dax Shepard, following her split with Chris, she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a>: "I need to figure out what the purpose [of marriage] is. Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits. I am a romantic. I believe in a partnership, I believe in companionship. I just don’t know if I believe in a ceremony of a wedding."</p><p>She's been pretty open about her doubts and concerns when it comes to marriage, suggesting that she probably wouldn't go to the trouble of saying "I do" again. But considering her new bling, it looks like Michael may have convinced her to give it another shot!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruvrYyfmKuho2Kyr7PAoJyd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
