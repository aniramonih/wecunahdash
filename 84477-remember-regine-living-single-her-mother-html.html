But Kim had her incredible mother, who’s also part of the entertainment industry, to guide her along the way.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>While talking with Steve, the host took the time to ask Kim how was her mom doing, and she surprised him by pointing out to the public and prompting him to ask her himself since she was seating in the public.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>A very emotional Steve Harvey stood up and walked to Chip, who was waiting with tears in her eyes as well and embraced the man as if he was one of her kids. The moment was cut short after Chip said: “Go back to your stage.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Harvey then proceeded to explain the moment, revealing that if it wasn’t for Chip he wouldn’t be where he is today, saying:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>“Let me tell you something, I’m telling you right now. They was gonna put me off the TV. I didn’t know what I was doing. This woman sat with me for 12 hours and turned me into an actor overnight. I went back the next day and they decided to keep the show. I was done. That girl right there, she saved me.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>We couldn’t have imagined that Steve Harvey owes a lot of his career to Chip Fields, but we’re glad to know she was there to guide him on a difficult time of his life just as she’s been doing with her daughters.</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Steve Harvey Will Be a Grandpa Again - Grandkids Give Him Reason to ‘Wake Up’ after Homeless Life</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Daughter Asks Doctor to Turn Her Dad’s Life Support Off, 'I Knew It!'
