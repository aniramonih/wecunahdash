If it wasn't for him, none of this is possible. And I continue to pray no matter what! Good day I pray and bad day I continue to pray, because I know that without God none of this is possible. I give all my thanks and worship to God each and every day. Walking by faith is the best thing I have ever done. I can only know that God will lead me to much greater paths in my life," she told Women Fitness.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko6GcocZurc2aoKxlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZqiVp7Omr9No</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
