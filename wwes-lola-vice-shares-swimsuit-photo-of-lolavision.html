"Sunkissed commented one of her followers. "Queen," added another. How does the wrestler keep her body in shape? Here are some of her top lifestyle tips.</span></p><p><span>Valerie keeps her diet clean. "On both training days and active recovery days I drink a lot of water and try to eat clean," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Vital Proteins</span></a><span>. "Every morning, I train fasted ‚Äì meaning I don't eat anything before working out. Afterward, I usually have some sort of protein, a carb and healthy </span><span>fat like avocado. As for why I train fasted, I find, in my experience, it's a great way to maintain my weight. I also feel lean while exercising."</span></p><p><span>Sure, Lola pumps iron but she also strikes a yoga pose. "On active recovery days, doing yoga is my go-to because it helps to release the lactic acid from my legs and the next morning I am not as sore," she told Vital Proteins.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_1965080992.jpg><p><span>Valerie spikes her coffee with collagen. "For about a month now I've been adding two scoops of the Collagen Peptides in my coffee every morning and I have seen a drastic change in my hair, nails and skin. I also use Vital Performance‚Ñ¢ RECOVER after every training session and I feel immediately renovated," she told them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Valerie is all about fighting forms of fitness. "I think for women, one of the biggest things martial arts teaches you, in general, is confidence. You know, with confidence, you can do things. I've always been the only girl in my class, all full of men‚Äî for example, boxing‚Äî but I have the confidence to do that. For a woman who want to get started, I'd say start with boxing because I feel like boxing is a huge stress relief for a lot of women," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle & Fitness</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>"I'm very big on my routine with my vitamins, my supplements and, and my nutrition," Valerie confessed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle & Fitness</span></a><span>. "So I do eat healthy, and I don't eat a lot of carbs. But if there's something I'm very disciplined with, it's my vitamins and my blood work is really important to me."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLjDxKxkpaeclnq3tcKeZKygkaeytHnSsKCmq6WewW68x6irqGWfm3qtu8uaraKrmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
