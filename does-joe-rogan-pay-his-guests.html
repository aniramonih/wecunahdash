Recommended Videos The JRE is a longform podcast that can go for over three hours, and he knows how to find the celebrities that make that time exciting. Being ranked the top podcast out of the sheer millions that have swarmed the internet, Sportskeedia ranks his most explosive guests from Candace Owens claiming that climate change doesn’t exist and Jordan Peterson’s views on political correctness to Edward Snowden calling in to be on the show and Elon Musk smoking weed when he was at one time against it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Of course no more needs to be said about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the controversy Alex Jones can bring</a>.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Rogan’s not always controversial, though. He has had great conversations with huge celebrities like Mike Tyson, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Russell Brand, and Jamie Foxx just to name a few. The one thing they all have in common is that not one of them gets a dime for coming on his show.</p><h2 id=h-joe-rogan-getting-paid data-injectable=false>Joe Rogan getting paid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/joe-rogan-ufc.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reporting that Rogan has a net worth of $120 million and a yearly salary of $60 million, he makes sure he gets paid. Of course, he was a comedian and an actor before becoming one of the star commentators for the UFC. He has clout, and he can drop more celebrity names than a “who’s who” at the Oscars.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>When stars go on talk shows late at night, they get paid. That’s because of SAG/AFTRA union agreements, and those contracts are airtight. Rogan somehow sidesteps all that legal jargon because he pays in exposure.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>The celebrities he has on his show you wouldn’t think need any more exposure because they’re getting it on the talk shows and in the headlines every time they blink an eye. However, taking into account Rogan’s numbers across the net, reaching millions is worth the time. To be honest, celebrities love going on his show because they never know what they’re going to be getting into.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=false>His show is all over the place from sports to comedy and politics to science. He doesn’t always have celebrities on his show because sometimes, they’re experts in a field or up-and-coming in the industry. Exposure is great pay for a cause or for anyone trying to advance their careers. So no, no one gets paid to appear on the Joe Rogan Experience even though some celebrities might get certain expenditures compensated like hotel rooms, transportation, and meals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZqGonV2nvKitzWanmrFdnba0ecaunKyso2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
