This is not surprising, as broadcasting is one of the highest paying career options. Though the popular anchor has not disclosed her salary, we can safely say that it has to be fairly significant to accumulate such net worth.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span> <img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14382 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Jenna-Lee-net-worth.jpg alt="Image of Journalist, Jenna Lee net worth is $5 million" width=600 height=605 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-14382 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Journalist, Jenna Lee net worth is $5.5 million</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><span style=font-weight:400>Like most beautiful media personalities, Jenna is also called upon to advertise various goods and services. Advertising pays handsomely, and it has in all likelihood helped her build her impressive net worth. The anchor is also constantly featured in magazines.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%98Fox-News-anchor-Jenna-Lee-Career></span><b>‘Fox News’ anchor Jenna Lee Career</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Straight out of UC Santa Barbara, Lee embarked on her journalism career as a freelance writer for the Marina Times. This was a local newspaper based in San Francisco. The soon to be anchor stayed with the paper for two years, before she found herself at Columbia University.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-103></span><p><span style=font-weight:400>While here, she would work for NY1 while moonlighting for Forbes, a celebrity gossip site. The latter proved the more lucrative venture, and she subsequently left her work at NY1 to pursue it full time.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14383 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Jenna-Lee-profession.jpg alt="Image of Newsreader, Jenna Lee" width=600 height=366 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-14383 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Newsreader, Jenna Lee</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104></span><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her big break finally came in 2007 when she was personally brought on by the CEO of Fox News to co-anchor the Fox Business News. &nbsp;Lee’s charm shone through on the show, prompting the network to add her as an additional correspondent to the <a href=#>Money for the Breakfast show</a>. Once that show was done, she was moved to a different show, “Imus in the Morning.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jenna officially joined the Fox News Channel in 2010, when she was brought on to co-host the Happening Now, with Jon Scott. &nbsp;She would stay on the show for a good eight years, before bowing out to pursue other interests.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jenna-Lee-Married-to-husband-Leif-Babin></span><b>Jenna Lee Married to husband, Leif Babin.</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The stunning broadcaster is, in fact, a married woman. And if that isn’t enough to put off anyone who might have had a crush on her, then maybe the fact that her husband is a Navy Seal will. Jenna is married to Leif Babin, an American soldier. The pair first met in 2008 at a fundraiser for the troops.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sparks must have flown in between them that night as they were married three years later. The wedding took place on the 3</span><span style=font-weight:400>rd</span><span style=font-weight:400> of July, 2011 in Wimberley, Texas. Jenna’s husband is a decorated war hero who has served his country proudly. Some of his achievements include: being awarded a Purple Heart, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star for his efforts in Anbar Province, Iraq. Leif and his wife Jenna have two children together: Liberty Josephine and Babin Brian Marc Babin.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span> <img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14384 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritydig.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Jenna-Lee-husband.jpg alt="Image of Jenna Lee with her husband Leif Babin" width=600 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-14384 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Jenna Lee with her husband, Leif Babin</strong></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The happy couple and their family all live in Texas. Through the various pictures of Jenna posts on social media, it is very easy to see that her husband truly makes her content. Both she and her children are proud of what he does for their country. Even if it means that they do not get to see him over extended periods. Leif Babin is a good soldier, and an even better husband and father.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jenna-Lee-Age-Parents-Wiki-Bio></span><b>Jenna Lee Age, Parents, Wiki-Bio.</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Full name</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Jennifer Anne Lee</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Age</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>41 years old.</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Date of Birth</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>May 30</span><span style=font-weight:400>th</span><span style=font-weight:400>1980</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Place of Birth</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>San Francisco, California, USA</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Profession</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Television Personality</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Net worth</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$ 5.5 million</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Husband</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Leif Babin</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Kids</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>2</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Nationality</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>American</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Ethnicity</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Caucasian</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Zodiac Sign</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Gemini</span></td></tr><tr><td><b>Parents</b></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Janice Lee and Bob Lee</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jennifer Anne Lee was born on the 30</span><span style=font-weight:400>th</span><span style=font-weight:400> of May, 1980 to parents Janice and Bob Lee in San Francisco, California.
