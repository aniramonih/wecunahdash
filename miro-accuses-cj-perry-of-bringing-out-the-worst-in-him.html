She is finally All Elite, but that may not be the best thing for Miro right now. According to him, his own wife brings out a part of him he doesn’t consider as his best side.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News provided comprehensive coverage of AEW Dynamite this week</a>. There were a few interesting angles that really shook things up. Miro and CJ Perry’s ongoing saga was no different.</p><p>CJ Perry, also known as Lana, has responded to recent comments made by Miro regarding her influence on his character’s transformation following The Redeemer’s appearance on AEW Dynamite.</p><p>On the November 15th episode of AEW Dynamite, Miro made an appearance and discussed his relationship with his wife, CJ Perry. In a video segment, Miro expressed his thoughts on the situation. He is not too thrilled about how things are going right now.</p><p>“What I said would happen is coming true. I love that woman, but she’s bringing in a storm.“</p><p>“She wants gold and fame and fortune and all these things that drag her under.</p><p>“And, for years, I stood by and let her do whatever she wanted, but my eyes have been open for a while now.“</p><p>“Truth is, CJ doesn’t bring the worst out of herself, she brings the worst out of me, too.”</p><p>“And, this week, on Collision, Daniel Garcia will be the one to find out more than anyone else in this world, because I bring the worst of me, Daniel.</p><p>“Can’t wait to see you dance, because you will dance at the beginning, but you’ll be peaceful in the end. Now let The Redeemer give you a piece of advice, I don’t pray to God anymore, but you definitely should.</p><p>It appears that fans may see Andrade vs Miro in the future. A battle for CJ Perry’s services may be in the pipeline. This is not the way a lot of fans may have booked things, but it appears that Tony Khan’s company was able to figure out a way to get CJ Perry, and use her in an intriguing storyline.</p><p>We will keep a close eye on this story, along with everything else in the pro wrestling world, here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.
