He has earned a remarkable ten Tony Awards over the course of his illustrious career, which took off in the mid-1960s. Some of his notable credits include directing and choreographing “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” (1978), “Grand Hotel” (1989), and “The Will Rogers Follies” (1991), among numerous other productions.</p><p>Have you ever pondered the wealth of Tommy Tune as of mid-2017? According to authoritative sources, Tune’s net worth is estimated to be a hefty $20 million, a fortune amassed through his successful endeavors in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Tommy Tune’s Net Worth: $20 Million</h3><p>Tommy, the son of Jim Tune, a restaurateur, oil rig worker, and horse trainer, and Eva Mae Clark, attended Lamar High School in Houston. Later, he pursued his education at the Methodist-affiliated Lon Morris College in Jacksonville, Texas. Here, an interest in dancing blossomed, leading him to attend dance lessons under Patsy Swayze, alongside taking lessons from Kit Andree in Boulder, Colorado.</p><p>He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in drama from the University of Texas at Austin, and furthered his education at the University of Houston, earning a Master of Fine Arts in Directing. Upon completing his college education, Tommy headed to New York to make his mark in the professional arena.</p><p>His inaugural Broadway performance was in the musical “Baker Street” in 1965. However, it wasn’t until the mid-70s that he achieved his breakthrough. In 1974, his performance in the musical “Seesaw” earned him his first Tony Award in the category of Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical. His stint as the director and choreographer for the musical “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” four years later, as well as the musical comedy “A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine” in 1980, brought him accolades, including the Tony Award for Best Choreography and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography, among others. This was followed by directing the musical “Nine” in 1982, for which he secured his third Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical. In the ensuing years, his involvement in the musical “My One and Only” garnered him two more Tony Awards, for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical and Best Choreography. Noteworthy directorial and choreographic credits in the 80s came with “Stepping Out” in 1987, and as the director and choreographer of “Grand Hotel” in 1989. The latter garnered him his sixth and seventh Tonys, for Best Direction of a Musical and Best Choreography.</p><p>Tommy continued his successful run into the 90s, steering the production of “The Will Rogers Follies” in 1991, which led to two more Tony Awards, for Best Direction of a Musical and Best Choreography. This made him the only individual to triumph in consecutive years in the same categories. He also graced the musical “Bye Bye Birdie” in 1992, and was at the helm of the sequel to “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas”, titled “The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public”, in 1994. The same year, he supervised the revival of “Grease”.</p><p>In the new millennium, while Tommy’s stage appearances declined, he still featured in productions such as “Song and Dance Man” (2002), “White Tie and Tails” (2002), and “Paparazzi” (2003). Additionally, he headlined his own musical revue, titled “Steps in Time: A Broadway Biography in Song and Dance” (2008-2009). Notably, he made a comeback to the stage in City Center’s “Encores” series, and in 2015, he received a Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre.</p><p>Beyond the stage, Tommy also tasted success on the screen. His first appearance was in the musical comedy “Hello, Dolly” (1969), sharing the screen with Barbara Streisand, Walter Matthau, and Michael Crawford. Subsequently, he made guest appearances in TV productions such as the “Dean Martin Show” and its replacement, “Dean Martin Presents The Golddiggers”. After a hiatus, he resurfaced in 1988, featuring in the TV series “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”, assuming the role of Sir Thomas. More recently, he portrayed Argyle Austero in the sitcom “Arrested Development” (2013).</p><p>On a personal front, Tommy is openly gay. He was in a long-term relationship with David Wolfe, a stage manager who succumbed to AIDS in 1994, followed by a relationship with Michael Stuart, who passed away in 1997.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tommy Tune</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 28, 1939</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Wichita Falls, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 6½” (1.99 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Soundtrack, Miscellaneous Crew</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Texas at Austin, Lamar High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Jim Tune, Eva Mae Clark</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Gracey Tune</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876585/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Tony Award for Best Choreography, Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement, Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical, Tony Award for Best Lead Actor in a Musical, Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Dir…</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Laurence Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer, Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor, Visiting Production, Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Director, Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Choreographer</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Broadway’s Lost Treasures, The Boy Friend, Hello, Dolly!, Broadway’s Best at Pops</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=quotes><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My idea of gambling was walking through Central Park, whistling show tunes.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>As a joke he often says that he is 5’18½” tall.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Was the mentor of Broadway actress/singer Susan Egan.
