Well, this beautiful lady likes keeping her profile low. She has appeared in 2014 comedy short movie Butter Face&nbsp;by&nbsp;<span class=itemprop><strong>Ben Giroux</strong>.

The mother and daughter catch up frequently to spend quality time together. They are travel buddies. Mama’s favorite girl Storm not only shares a good bonding with her mother but also share the beautiful face. They look more like sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Storm-Brieanne-Sixx-mother.jpg><p>She is equally close to her father, Nikki. The father and daughter even got the matching cupcake tattoos on her twenty-fifth birthday. And her father could not stop himself from sharing a cute picture of the duo on his Instagram. He gushed that cupcake was Storm’s nickname back when she was a little girl. She definitely is a cupcake!</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Nikki Sixx (@nikkisixxpixx)</a> on Apr 14, 2019 at 11:11am PDT</p><p>Although Storm’s parents had a glamorous profession, she has not chosen the same way as her parents. Instead, she is living quite a lowkey life, and she loves the way she is living. Also, she is an artist. Her Instagram is full of abstract arts that she has made, and they are beautiful. Just give her a paper and some crayons, and she does the perfect thing!</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Storm_Brieanne_Sixx_Name_Meaning></span>Storm Brieanne Sixx: Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The name Storm is an English baby name which means tempest.
