This makes the actor significantly shorter than Armie Hammer, his on-screen love interest in "Call Me by Your Name." (Hammer is listed at 6 feet, 5 inches via <a href=#>IMDb</a>.) Prior to <a href=#>Hammer's fallout in Hollywood</a>, Chalamet said (via <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>) his co-star was a person who would "present themselves as they truly are. And Armie is as he truly is." For the role in his breakout film, Chalamet was only 17 years old when first heard from director Luca Guadagnino. The actor's biggest role at that time was in the film "Homeland," so Chalamet recalled to <a href=#>GQ</a>, "I was just grateful that he'd asked for the meeting."</p><p dir=ltr>Years later, Chalamet teamed up with perhaps the only other Gen Z actor possibly more popular than him: Zendaya. The two were part of the spectacular cast for the 2021 film "Dune." On set, Zendaya and Chalamet instantly clicked. The actor told <a href=#>E!</a> that she knew right away about Chalamet, "we're going to be friends for life." Both ruled the red carpets in incredible looks during the press tour for the film. More than just an interest in fashion, the two are also the same height, with <a href=#>Zendaya measuring in at 5 feet, 10 inches</a>. But unless she's wearing heels, Chalamet might slightly tower over her because of his love for elevated boots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pibH9xe8eormaskaG5brXSZquipZ%2BptaaxjJyfmqSRorK1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
