However, despite this desire, according to a 2017 study, only <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>10% of women</a> and 18% of men have engaged in a threesome. If you fall into the group that has always thought about a threesome but has yet to turn the fantasy into a reality, read on for my essential rules for having a successful first threesome.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-first-think-about-why-you-want-to-have-a-threesome></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. First, think about why you want to have a threesome.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I need to state a disclaimer: I generally don't recommend threesomes for couples in committed relationships. I'm all for them for people in casual, non-committed relationships, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>situationships</a>. But as a relationship therapist, I care most about the long-term impact on the couple dynamic, which leaves me with several concerns.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, if the threesome idea was sparked by boredom in the bedroom, bringing a new person into the mix disincentives you from putting energy and creativity into your sex life with your partner. You're no longer working to up your game and figure out new fantasies to explore, techniques to try, and preferences your partner may have that you haven't yet probed. While a threesome may be exciting initially, it does not solve the longer-term issue of how to keep things fresh and become a better lover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have also seen way too many jealousy issues arise and emotional bonds form as a result of what was supposed to be "meaningless" sex. Sometimes, people who have a hard time with emotional intimacy find it hard to maintain sexual interest in their long-term partner; for them, opening the relationship to other people is an ineffective Band-Air and can stunt personal growth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-when-choosing-a-partner-dont-make-the-fatal-mistake></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. When choosing a partner, don’t make the fatal mistake.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to picking a third, many couples gravitate to someone they know. This is a huge mistake. Inviting someone into the bedroom who one or both of you already have an emotional bond with makes it more likely that someone will have feelings or someone will get their feelings hurt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Picking up strangers at bars can also be tricky. Fortunately, there are many apps, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Thrinder</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Feeld</a>, designed specifically to help you out. Once you both agree on a potential partner, I recommend meeting her for an IRL "date" before inviting her straight to bed, so you can make sure they are true to their photo, test the chemistry, and see how it feels to take the next step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With that said, now more than ever, it's important to consider safety when it comes to who you are bringing into your bed...</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-put-safety-first></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Put safety first.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Early on in the pandemic, health experts and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>local governments recommended</a> limiting close contact — including sex — with anyone outside your household. Things may be more relaxed now, but with Delta breakthrough infections turning up at every corner, it's still important to talk about Covid-19 risk factors beforehand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you do feel comfortable moving forward, there are other safety measures to consider. First up: Birth control. You should talk about birth control with your partner and your guest star before the big event. Make sure that if your boyfriend is wearing a condom he does not double-dip. Check that everyone involved has a clean bill of health and establish in advance with your partner whether there will be any exchanging of bodily fluids. Limiting drugs and alcohol prevent things from getting out of control and makes it easier for everyone to keep their agreements.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-make-a-sex-act-checklist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Make a sex act checklist.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some couples make a no-penetration rule. Others embrace a watch-but-don't-touch philosophy. For other couples, it's about limiting intimacy during the threesome experience and focusing solely on sex, aka no kissing or cuddling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However you feel, it's important to go over every possible sexual scenario together and talk about what is off-limits and what is acceptable. Just because you are all getting naked together does not mean that it is a no-holds-barred sexual experience. Physical rules should be established upfront in order for this to be an emotionally safe experience.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-state-your-fears></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. State your fears.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Communication is key when bringing a third party into the mix. You both must be skilled in talking about delicate topics, and be willing to share any concerns or fears in advance. Find out what your boyfriend's expectations of the event are and share yours. If during this conversation you discover that one of you isn't fully on board or enthusiastic about the idea, it's best not to move forward. A threesome should never be about doing something solely for your partner's pleasure or 'taking one for the team'.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-pick-a-safety-word></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Pick a safety word.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moment one person becomes uncomfortable, they should have the right to end the threesome, no questions asked. One way to do this is by creating a safety word with your boyfriend. This is something that either of you can say that indicates that you're no longer feeling comfortable with the situation. Discuss in advance that this may be a real possibility that neither partner can roll their eyes at.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-follow-the-leader></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Follow the leader.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It can also be helpful to discuss who will lead in this sexual dance that you will be doing. Who's going to be the person to initiate physical activity with your new partner? Who is going to politely end things if that's what it comes to? It may seem un-sexy, but talking all of these logistics through in advance can make sure things go smoothly once you bring in a third person.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-establish-relationship-boundaries></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Establish relationship boundaries.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of time, set explicit boundaries about staying in contact before, during, and after the threesome. Is it OK for you or your boyfriend to text the other woman without their partner knowing? How do you want to handle things after the event is over? Is she invited to spend the night? Are you having breakfast together in the morning? Are you hoping to escort her out ASAP? Most couples find it helpful to say a kind goodbye to the third party relatively quickly and find time to connect with one another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to be clear on whether or not this is a one-time thing or if either of you is hoping to have this be a regular activity and, if so, with the same person every time. Stay true to these commitments. All too often people get slippery about the agreements they make, develop bonds with the non-primary partner, become jealous, or hurt each other's feelings.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-9-talk-to-the-newcomer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>9. Talk to the newcomer.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While all of these tips are about protecting your relationship with your partner, be sure to discuss expectations, boundaries, and protocol with the newcomer, too. They also have the right to bow out if they feel uncomfortable at any point. You all need to be on the same page in order for everyone to feel respected and have a good time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706Gpnp2jpLqmedGuo56rXWqAen6RcnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
