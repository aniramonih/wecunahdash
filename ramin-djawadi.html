This was the most significant turning point of his life as he was subsequently hired by Han’s music production company called Remote Control Productions.</p><p>During his stay at Remote, Ramin served as the assistant to <strong>Klaus Badelt</strong>. Moreover, he worked on several projects with Hans. Later, both of them though went their separate ways, it cannot be stressed enough how massive an influence Hans had in his now world-class career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/ezgif.com-resize-32-2.jpg alt="Hans Zimmer played a huge role in Ramin Djawadi's stride to greatness." width=450 height=650 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Hans Zimmer played a huge role in Ramin Djawadi's stride to greatness.</strong><br><strong>Source: Zimbio</strong></p><p>Ramin’s soundtracks and film scores are in three digits by now.

Ramin’s movie career is undoubtedly pretty good, but his performance in the small screens is how he became one of the best composers in the entire world.</p><h2>Ramin Djawadi is married to his wife Jennifer Hawks; Shares twins</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/ezgif.com-resize-31-2.jpg alt="Ramin Djawdi and his wife Jennifer Hawks at the Grammy Awards." width=450 height=677 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Ramin Djawadi with his wife Jennifer Hawks at the Grammy Awards.</strong><br><strong>Source: Zimbio</strong></p><p>Djawadi is married to his wife <strong>Jennifer Hawks</strong>, who is a successful music executive in Hollywood.

I just always hear music in my head. I thought that was normal. My wife said, ‘Ramin, that’s not normal.”</p><h2>Djawadi is able to visualize music</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2019/10/ezgif.com-resize-30-2.jpg alt="Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djwadi's perceptual phenomenon allows him to associate colors with numbers." width=450 height=261 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Ramin Djwadi's perceptual phenomenon allows him to associate colors with numbers.</strong><br><strong>Source: Gold Derby</strong></p><p>A sensory condition called <a href=# rel=noopener>synesthesia</a> allows Ramin to associate colors with numbers as well as numbers with colors. This perceptual phenomenon helps him visualize music.</p><p>Perhaps this is one of the major reasons he does not require a sheet and can play music from memory. Meanwhile, it comes as no surprise the composer is critically acclaimed by fans and critics alike. He was always exceptional, but his fame grew exponentially following the season 6 finale of Game of Thrones, The Winds of Winter.</p><p>Check out <strong><a href=#>celebsindepth.com</a></strong> for more <strong><a href=#>biography</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>gossip</a></strong> of your favorite stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGipmqWZo3qltsCwmJ2hXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
