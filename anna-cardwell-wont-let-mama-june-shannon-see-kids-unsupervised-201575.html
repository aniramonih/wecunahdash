On TLC’s Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, viewers saw <strong>June “Mama” Shannon</strong> happily take care of her granddaughter, Kaitlyn, but when daughter Anna “Chickadee” Cardwell gives birth to her second baby, Shannon will have to keep her distance.</p><p>Confirming her eldest daughter’s second pregnancy in an <a href=#>April 25 Instagram post</a>, Shannon couldn’t help but voice her concern that Cardwell, 20, and her husband, Michael, are too young to expand their family. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it: I’m nervous for them, as I know they are struggling with just them and Kaitlyn right now. Adding another one is going to be hard,” Shannon wrote. “They are in a different state for me to help her out like I was able to help a lot with Kaitlyn, but going to try to be [as] supportive as possible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>As Cardwell tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>, her relationship with Shannon remains fractured — and she’s willing to go into protective mama bear mode when necessary if things don’t get better. “We fuss and fight about this pregnancy thing,” said Cardwell, telling <strong>Us</strong> that while she trusts Shannon “a little,” it’s her husband who has the real issue. “If I have a newborn child, either me and Michael are going to go [visit with the baby] or she can come over here and visit,” said Cardwell, who moved from Shannon’s home in Georgia to live at her father-in-law’s home in Alabama.</p><p>Cardwell also takes issue with Shannon’s claim that the couple cannot financially support another child. “Every family struggles with all this stuff — even with one kid, [but] we make it — every single day. [Kaitlyn] gets what she wants, she eats, has clothes on her, she’s clean. This same kid is going to be the same way,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One relationship that has improved throughout Cardwell’s second pregnancy is her relationship with her husband. “We were arguing a lot . . . then all of a sudden we started doing fine for a good two or three months, and we decided to try again [to get pregnant]. I’m glad,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “I begged and begged and begged for a kid and I finally got [pregnant].”</p><p>The couple, who celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary on May 3, are itching to return to reality TV after their TLC series was canceled in October 2014. “Me and Michael are hoping to get our own show. I want to get our own show and let everybody see Kaitlyn growing up and see how our family is growing too, now with the baby coming.””</p><p>While she attempts to mend her fractured relationship with Shannon, Cardwell is keeping the focus on Kaitlyn, who turns 3 years old in July. “I try and explain to her, ‘Hey, you might have a brother or sister,’ and she’s like, ‘Oh no, mama, you’ve got noodles in your belly!'” Cardwell told <strong>Us</strong>. “Once I start getting bigger and she starts feeling it I will explain more to her, but right now I’m not showing that much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJinppFisKK%2Bw7CcpaRdrLyvwIylnK1lnZa6onnJrqWeZaOdrq%2B6zqdkrJ2VYriqsNJmrKerpaWys8LIrJydZWJlfnaDlA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
