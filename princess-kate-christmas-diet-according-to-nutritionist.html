A few key substitutions could leave Princess Kate in good stead when it comes to her royal duties, from her &#34;high energy&#34; breakfast she enjoys in private to her organic, immune-boosting trimmings thanks to her father-in-law King Charles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Take a look at Kate's Christmas on a plate, according to experts at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bulk.com</a>…</p><h2 dir=ltr>Christmas breakfast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a2a011c42e41-charles-camilla-harry-william.jpg><p id=eDoXwNHQC1k data-wc=63>&nbsp;According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, who worked for Princess Diana, Prince Harry and Prince William, the men and women traditionally eat their breakfasts separately on Christmas Day. The women tend to get lighter foods such as toast, yoghurt or fruit delivered to their rooms, while the men start the day with a larger meal of eggs, grilled kidneys, kippers and bacon.</p><p id=e0Xt4oM9Hf8 data-wc=55>Nutritionists believe Kate's lighter, nutritious breakfast reduces the risk of feeling bloated and sluggish and helps improve energy levels and concentration. It is also a great way to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease, which go hand in hand with processed meats such as sausages, bacon and sugary breakfast cereals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/836360158018-gettyimages-1842394306.jpg><p id=eERMW5xcvRg data-wc=32>The Princess has been <a class=hm-link href=#>known to favour</a> antioxidant-rich green smoothies and oatmeal in her daily diet, so it's possible she would choose the food packed with soluble fibre to kick-start the festivities. &nbsp;</p><p id=edAIEXL7K1Z data-wc=42>"This can curb those mid-morning or late-night cravings, making it easier to stick to a lower calorie intake across the day. The fibre in oats also helps regulate blood sugar levels, which is crucial for weight management," said nutritionist Charlotte Faure Green.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Christmas lunch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3bff09f9156f-kate-middleton-laughing-prince-william-eating.jpg><p id=er7hgQ6YhdI data-wc=56>Darren previously told HELLO! the royals always had a "boring" Christmas lunch that followed the same format. "They didn't do hams or anything, just traditional turkeys," he said, adding that it would be accompanied by "different stuffings – sage and onion, chestnut – and the traditional sides like roast potatoes, mash potatoes, parsnips and Brussels sprouts."</p><p id=eEkRBI-QReo data-wc=41>Many of these are likely to have been grown at Sandringham in Norfolk, where the royals host their Christmas celebrations. Since managing the estate in 2017, King Charles has had a focus on organic foods free from pesticides and other chemicals.</p><p id=eJ7Ms0lXk1m data-wc=83>Should Kate choose to a roastie or two to her plate, she would be upping her intake of fibre and antioxidants, nutritionists explained. This will keep her full for longer, lower her cholesterol and up her vitamin levels to help her ward off colds and flu that are common in winter. Plus, Kate's intake of carrots will add vitamin A to her diet, which is known to aid skin health – not that the Princess has ever struggled to achieve a glowing complexion!</p><p id=enVG6e-KcW data-wc=14>Want to replicate the royals' Christmas pudding?

"When I was there, Harrods would always give them a whole foie gras en croute. They'd have a whole Stilton cheese. We'd take the top off, pitchfork the top and pour port into it. It made this gorgeous spread for the crackers. It was really opulent. There was also a big York ham that was decorated."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb021c7175fb-kate-middleton-george-charlotte-louis-food-z.jpg><p id=e0TK5jpS8jlQ data-wc=48>Kate reportedly prefers vegetarian dishes, but she also gets her protein intake from some meats.
