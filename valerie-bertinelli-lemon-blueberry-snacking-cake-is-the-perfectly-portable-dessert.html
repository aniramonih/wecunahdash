Because you can add any flavor that you want to add.</p><p>“So, making a cake is really easy; it just takes this little road map. You want to cream your butter and sugar. You want to have dry ingredients with a leavener in it and a little bit of salt. And then you want your wet ingredients to have some flavor in it, so that’s what we’re going to do.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/bO3YYZzfd0c?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><h2>Bertinelli’s easy cake comes together quickly</h2><p>The <a href=#>Valerie’s Home Cooking</a> host starts with the compote. The fresh blueberries go into a saucepot, followed by the lemon juice “just to break up the blueberries as they heat up.”</p><p>Compote, Bertinelli says, “is a thickened fruit sauce. You really want the beautiful flavor of the fruit. You also want a little sugar,” which she adds to the mixture.</p><p>The flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt are whisked together “so they blend.”</p><p>Now the wet ingredients of lemon juice, milk, and vanilla are combined. Bertinelli creams the butter and sugar, turning up the speed so it gets “really nice and creamy.” She adds the eggs, letting each one “incorporate before you add the next one.” Now, the former <a href=#>One Day at a Time</a> star adds the lemon zest, followed by the dry ingredients.</p><p>Here’s the fun part: spread the batter into a 9 x 13 cake pan; then pour the blueberry compote over it and “kind of stir it” into the batter with a butter knife.</p><p>Bake at 350 degrees for about half an hour. When the cake is done and while it’s cooling is a great time, Bertinelli says, to assemble the frosting ingredients. Glaze the cooled cake and then dot with more fresh blueberries.</p><p>Get the full recipe and reviews <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Food Network’s site</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p>Another deliciously blueberry-centric dessert from Food Network’s Valerie Bertinelli.</figure><h2>Reviewers loved Bertinelli’s sunny cake</h2><p>Teeming with citrusy flavor and fresh blueberries, Bertinelli’s cake is a portable snack perfect with coffee, chocolate milk, or just on its own, as Food Network reviewers pointed out.</p><p>“I just made this today it was fantastic! My husband loves anything lemon and this did not disappoint. Will definitely make again. Thanks Valerie!!,” said one home cook.</p><p>Another fan of the recipe tried it with an entirely different citrus flavoring with great results: “Delicious! The cake turned out light and moist … I ended up using fresh orange juice and peel as I thought I had lemon and didn’t.&nbsp; I used about 1/2 the frosting recipe and then folded it into whipped cream. I added slivered almonds to the top along with the blueberries. Looked and tasted great!”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Valerie Bertinelli on What Betty White Loved Seeing on Menus: ‘This Favorite of Hers’</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOr5ilnaKesm6uxKuroqaVobmqecuepKimXZe5trHBnqmrsV2ou6KvyqKloGWTlrimecisZK2glWK9pr7FnpqtpKlivbC%2B05qZpZ1dmbK0v8Srq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
