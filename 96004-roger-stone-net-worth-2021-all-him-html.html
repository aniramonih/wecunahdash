He was brought up in a middle-class family by his parents in New York within the Vista community. Joseph got involved in the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy in 1960 while still in grade <a href=#>school</a>.</p><p class=align-left>He then joined John Jay High School in New York, where he was the vice president of the student governing body and later became the president. He joined George Washington University but left in 1972 to work for the committee of then-President Richard Nixon.</p><h3>Professional life</h3><p class=align-left>The political analyst has had quite a progressive career in both political strategy and lobbying. He has had the opportunity to take part in both these fields. Over the years, he has managed to establish a political name.</p><h4><strong>Political administration</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Stone launched his political career in 1972. He would be involved in the defamation of Nixon's oppositions. This was done through the organization Young Socialist Alliance. The information would then be leaked to the local paper, Manchester Union-Leader.</p><p class=align-left>He worked with the Office of Economic Opportunity after Nixon's presidential win in 1972. After Nixon's resignation, he briefly worked with Bob Dole. He was fired on account of being a "Nixon dirty trickster." He has worked closely with other politicians like Jack Kemp, Ronald Reagan, Arlen Specter, <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, Kristin Davis, and Thomas Golisano.</p><h4><strong>Lobbying</strong></h4><p class=align-left>In 1980, Roger, together with Paul Manafort and Charlie Black, co-founded a lobbying organization. The firm went by the name Black, Manafort & Stone (BMS). It was the first and <a href=#>best </a>of its kind in Washington, DC. The purpose of the firm was to provide political consultation. The firm gained a new member in 1985 after Republican political strategist Lee Atwater joined. However, a few years later, in the 90s, both Roger and Paul sold out their<a href=#> business</a> shares.</p><h3>Family life</h3><p class=align-left>The political consultant's first marriage was in 1974 to Anne Elizabeth Wesche. The two met while still at university. However, their union did not last long as they divorced in 1990. He married his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">second wife</a>, Nydia Bertran, in 1992. He has one child and a grandson, Nick Stevens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1e86d9b404e70d46.jpg><h2>Roger Stone achievements</h2><p class=align-left>In 1975, he was the co-founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee to develop independent expenditure political <a href=#>advertising</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In 1977, Joseph clinched the position of president for the Young Republicans campaign. He was 24 years old at the time of his appointment. He has also been featured in some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">documentaries</a> and television screenings. Some Roger Stone films include:</p><ul><li><i>Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story </i>(2008)</li><li><i>Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer </i>(2010)</li><li><i>Get me Roger Stone </i>(2017)</li></ul><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>As of 2021, the political strategist was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">valued to be</a> $50,000. He could have been valued at much more, but his legal cases have seen him have to pay up large sums of money to get legal services.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e37b1cb1c0c0a56c.jpg><h2>Stone controversies</h2><p class=align-left>Joseph is no stranger when it comes to controversy. He has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">back tattoo</a> of the face of Richard Nixon. During his campaigning for Senator Bob Dole in 1996, he came under fire for placing sexualized adverts on websites. He denied the claims but later in 2008, during an interview, admitted to the adverts.</p><p class=align-left>During the reigns of the lobbying firm BMS, he associated with merciless dictators from the rest of the <a href=#>world</a>. The firm coined the name <i>The Torturers Lobby</i>. His associations include the likes of Mobutu Sese Seko and Ferdinand Marcos.</p><p class=align-left>He has also been linked to dubious actions with Israel and Russia during the 2016 US presidential elections. His links point out that he was involved in leaking private emails to tarnish the presidential bid of Democrat Hillary Clinton. In recent news, the political strategist is under investigation as to whether he was involved in the January 2021 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Capitol Riot</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4c8d38dac10173c4.jpg><h3>Stone arrest</h3><p class=align-left>On the 25th of January 2019, Joseph was arrested at his home on several accounts.
