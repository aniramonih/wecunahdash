Main Street. At around 9:02 p.m.</strong>, emergency services and the Mackinaw Police Department received a distressing report of a collision involving a vehicle and a pedestrian. The pedestrian was identified as Adrian Taylor-Zehr, a 9-year-old boy residing on Kruse Street. Adrian’s condition was dire as he was found unresponsive, not breathing, and without a pulse. Swift action was taken to rush him to OSF Healthcare Saint Francis Medical Center, but despite the medical team’s valiant efforts and aggressive resuscitation measures, Adrian’s injuries proved fatal.

The Mackinaw community mourns the loss of this young life and stands in solidarity with Adrian’s grieving family during this incredibly difficult time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>The Illinois State Police Traffic Crash Reconstruction Unit is currently investigating the circumstances surrounding this heartbreaking accident.
