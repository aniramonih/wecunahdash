His parents, Mary and Joseph, raised Rick and his brother, John, on a farm near Palmer Springs, Virginia. When Rick was 14, he built a 1931 Chevrolet and started drag racing, and at 16, he won the Chrysler-Plymouth Troubleshooting Contest (Virginia division). Hendrick attended Park View High School in Virginia, and though he originally considered a career in baseball, he enrolled in a co-op work study program after graduation offered by Westinghouse Electric Company and North Carolina State University.</p><h2 id=hendrick-automotive-group><strong>Hendrick Automotive Group</strong></h2><p>After college, Hendrick opened a small used-car lot and became the general sales manager at age 23. After buying a Bennettsville, South Carolina, franchise, Rick became America's youngest Chevrolet dealer at 26 years old and went on to found Hendrick Automotive Group, which employs more than 10,000 people. In 2016, the company earned $9 billion in revenue.</p><h2 id=racing-career><strong>Racing Career</strong></h2><p>As a race car driver, Hendrick competed in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. He also started a drag boat racing team in the late 70s that won three championships and set a world record. Rick later co-owned and sponsored a few NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Series cars, earning a win with Dale Earnhardt in 1983. The following year, Hendrick started All-Star Racing (now known as Hendrick Motorsports), fielding a NASCAR Winston Cup team.

The Hendrick Motorsports headquarters is in Concord, North Carolina, and lies on a 140-acre property; 600 people are employed in the 430,000 square foot facility.

In 1999, the Be The Match Foundation honored Rick and Linda with their Leadership for the Life Award. Hendrick also supports Charlotte's Levin Children's Hospital and The Hendrick Foundation for Children, which was founded by his late brother in 2004.

The Hendrick Family Foundation supports charities that were established by Hendrick Motorsports drivers, such as the Chase Elliott Foundation, which offers financial support to other charitable organizations, and the Jimmie Johnson Foundation, which has contributed to several charities and raises funds for K-12 public education through their Jimmie Johnson Foundation Champions Grant program.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166542 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GettyImages-114798629.jpg alt="Rick Hendrick" width=442 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-166542 class=wp-caption-text>Jerry Markland/ Getty Images</p><h2 id=awards-honors><strong>Awards and Honors</strong></h2><p>In 1996, Hendrick received The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, the highest civilian honor given in the state of North Carolina.
