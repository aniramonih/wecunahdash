Turns Out It's Worth $100 Million</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-13</div><p>Off the coast of <span id=ext-gen168>Palawan Island in the <a href=#>Philippines</a>, an anonymous fisherman found something many of us might consider the stuff of pure fiction: A massive, 34kg <a href=#>pearl </a>inside of a giant clam. Almost as unbelievable as the pearl itself is the fact that the man, not knowing its actual monetary value, reportedly kept it as a "good luck charm" in his home for ten years.</span></p><p>The giant pearl is not the perfect spherical shape you might be picturing but instead a huge, misshapen blob, albeit one that's valued at about a hundred million dollars. And incredibly, the fisherman would have continued to use it as a piece of furniture had his house not accidentally burned down, after which a tourism officer saw it and began the process of determining its value. Here's that tourism officer, in his own words:</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span id=ext-gen171>"We were amazed when he brought it to us. We now need help from gemologists to fully certify it. We're waiting for authentication from Gemologist Institute and other international authorities. </span>But we believe Puerto Princesca is likely earn another prestigious title and a record breaker for having the world's biggest natural giant pearl from a giant clam."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-240296 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2017-11-27-at-3.25.45-PM.png alt width=720 height=532 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-240296 class=wp-caption-text>Photo via Drow male – Власна робота/Wikimedia Commons</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The tourism officer is right, since this as-yet-unnamed pearl easily dwarfs the current record holder for the title, the <span id=ext-gen175>Pearl of Lao. The Pearl of Lao </span>was discovered way back in 1934 and weighs less than half what this new one weighs, and is valued at a little over a third of this one's $100 million value.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, the <span id=ext-gen172>1-foot-wide, 2.2-foot-long pearl changes careers from a good luck charm to a tourist attraction, hopefully bringing more visitors to the Philippines, and perhaps a few treasure-seekers on the lookout for any particularly large clam. Hopefully, the man who found it won't have any trouble getting (at the very least) a generous finder's fee for the pearl. Unless, of course, he wants to continue to use it as a good luck charm –&nbsp;although it seems clear that he doesn't need any charms to bolster his luck, since he was lucky enough to find the thing in the first place.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmn6GjnbKzucCnZJ%2BhnpnAbrPImqWtZaCarrO4jLCmq6yYYn5xfIymoKWkmaS7brfEnqesZaOasLOx02arnqZdrrKivtJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
