The 25-year-old was discovered unconscious at her Los Angeles home from what appeared to be a drug overdose. The medical emergency occurred just weeks after the Demi had admitted to relapsing during her six years of sobriety.</p><p>Hours after she was issued Narcan — an emergency medication to reverse the effects of a narcotic overdose — by an EMT and transported to a local medical facility, Demi’s rep issued a statement to the press reading:</p><p>“Demi is awake and with her family who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support. Some of the information being reported is incorrect and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4>https://www.instagram.com/p/B89sBZ7BLiM/<p>Though it was initially suspected the Disney Channel alum had overdosed on heroin, a source close to Demi told People that was not the case.</p><p>“Demi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons,” the insider said. “She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time — and is still in such a dark place. She was sober for a while, but not completely sober for six years.”</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>In August 2019, the former Disney star announced her return with a recurring role as Jenny on the final season of <i>Will & Grace</i>. In January 2020, Demi made her highly anticipated return to music during her performance at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards. It was her first televised performance since the incident and she blew it out of the water.</p><p>Following the performance, the actress has released new music and even sang the national anthem during the 2020 Super Bowl LIV. But with everything that’s going on in the world right now, we need to check on our friends who struggle in stressful times. That’s exactly what Miley Cyrus did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmpqGcmsZur9irrKxlkaOxbrDEpqBmpJ%2BrrrW7jKGmqKOVmXq2vIydrKuhnpx6pbXSp5yyZZSWxrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
